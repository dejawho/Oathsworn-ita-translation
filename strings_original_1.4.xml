    <string name="chp10_0_1__a">"The water rises, filling your eyes, ears and mouth. You instinctively hold your breath, frantically searching for an exit. The room has no doors, no windows. It is not your burning lungs that scare you, it is that you are out of options. No escape from the inevitable.

You jolt awake and immediately take a deep breath. It does not take a dreamreader to tell you the meaning of that one. You know. The Mendicants are dead. You fought men and monsters to bring them here. Hells, you nearly went mad and still it meant nothing. Just more bodies for the pyres. The plague had spread through them like wildfire. Their precautions, herbs and ungents could not save them. The few who had survived cited malefic powers and dared not return to the infected areas that grew larger every day. You could not blame them. Whatever it was, it was beyond their craft. Perhaps beyond anyone's craft. You shake your head straight, that kind of thinking gets you killed. There is always another way, you tell yourself, as the dream flashes in your mind once more."</string>
    <string name="chp10_105_1a__a">"Your path ahead is blocked by dense vegetation. You are about to turn back when you see a mound created by a half buried object, an amalgamation of root and stone, clearly not of human origin. Guide, excited by the discovery, alights the mound on nimble feet and places a hand on its surface. \"My people make this. The land remembers.\" You cannot fathom what the object is trying to express in its current state. \"We Dig?\" Guide knocks, the question implicit in her eyes.


Choose one:

If you wish to spend some time to unearth the memorial, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a direction to go in."</string>
    <string name="chp10_105_2a__a">The memorial is buried under several feet of earth and mulch. Together, you carefully clear away the covering of ages and reveal the much larger surfaces beneath.</string>
    <string name="chp10_105_2a__c">"Finally, you step back and survey the picture. In the middle, a strong humanoid figure takes aim with its long bow, the sun shining above his head where you also notice some spikes that could be horns or a crown. Other people are depicted beneath him in a submissive stance. 

This must be the old A'Dendri King that Guide was telling you about. \"Says he survived birth of Deepwood,\" Guide taps out. \"This is a warning, he is landless but still protects A'Dendri borders from beasts and tree killers.\" You ask who the tree killers are, and in reply she simply points at you. Returning your gaze to the depiction, you see beside the king there are some creatures, a large bird of prey and… three hounds. You realize what this means. The king is alive and you killed his dog. He is coming for you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_107_1a__a">"You come across a huge fallen tree, slowly decaying on the ground, its enormous trunk blocking your path. You begin to walk around it when you notice another trunk, growing into the other. You examine the tree some more, walking up its length, and also find two big main branches growing from the main stem, one of them broken. The peculiar tree has become a habitat of some gross Deepwood insects, wriggling around inside it. Finally, you come to the tree's crown and immediately notice something is not right. 

Where there should be branches and twigs, there are long thick vines protruding from the tree, lying flat on the floor of the forest, sinking into it like roots. They remind you of… Guide. She steps toward the top of the tree and touches the area that could once have been a face. Now, only slimy things grow there. Then she conveys, \"Ancient male A'Dendri. Long dead.\" She follows one of the vines and pokes around its underside a bit. Under it, there seems to be a hidden crevice and you can see a faint glow in it.


Choose one:

If you wish to help her lift the vine, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a direction to go in."</string>
    <string name="chp10_107_2__a">"Together, you lift the heavy vine from the ground. Inside the crevice, you find some old A'Dendri spores that are beginning to stir. In a moment, they will be in the wind."</string>
    <string name="chp10_107_3__a">"You take in the old, yet powerful spores left by the Ancient, a rush of memory and emotions floods your being. You see the frenzy of a battlefield. Deepwood monstrosities are coming for you and your kin. The defense lines collapse. You are broken, your life slowly seeping into the earth of your homeland. Your land is lost and so are you. 

The land changes, it belongs to the enemy now. The others are dead, there is only loneliness and endless decline - for centuries. Until your last day, when he comes for you. You see a great A'Dendri standing before you, with crown-like horns on his head and the shining bow and sword. The King lives! He bows to you, a last token of respect to a dying subject before his blade descends.

You shiver as your own consciousness takes over again. As you look over to the place where you saw the A'Dendri King in the Ancient's last living moments, you feel something, but then it is gone."</string>
    <string name="chp10_107_4__a">"Guide takes in the spores left by the Ancient and falls silent for several moments. She needs no words to convey the sense of sadness you sense she feels. Finally she begins to tap out an explanation in the Knock. \"He was great once, then the 'War of the Roots' came. Deepwood ate the land, all A'Dendri lost. Landless. He was broken, alone. In the end, his King came to give him peace.\"

As she says this, a strange feeling overcomes you, making the hair on the back of your neck stand up."</string>
    <string name="chp10_108_1a__a">"You have been both hunter and hunted, you know a few tricks to throw your pursuers off your scent. This terrain may be unfamiliar to you, but perfect for misdirection. You think taking a little detour might buy you some time.


Choose one:

If you wish to take a detour, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a direction to go in."</string>
    <string name="chp10_116_2__a">"Your hunter is getting closer, you can feel it. You take extra precautions to cover the group's tracks and are on guard all the time."</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_1__a">"Guide comes back from scouting ahead and explains, \"Journey end. Close.\" She seems to hesitate before adding more signs that translate to, \"Announce us. To A'Dendri. Permit me.\" With that, she is letting you sense her feelings of fear and doubt. Like all the A'Dendri you have met who now call the Green Streets of Verum home, she had escaped from that place once already. She has never revealed all of what happened in her homeland or why they fled, but from what you have pieced together there is some form of control or domination at work there.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_3__a">"Being spotted by your adversary is a risk you cannot take right now, as you are closing in on your goal. You will have to hope that the A'Dendri will allow you to enter the Wychwood unannounced and uninvited."</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_4__a">You can tell that Guide is afraid to return. You can see her ambivalence and give her a nod of encouragement, explaining that you think it would be wise not to enter the Wychwood unannounced and uninvited.</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_4__c">After you ask her to announce you, Guide quickly climbs a nearby tree and from there releases spores from the tips of her hair vines which are carried northward by the wind.</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_4__e">Only a short while later, a single spore floats toward you through the wood - an answer? Guide catches it and takes it in, her fear flares up again. She knocks quickly, \"He comes. Hurry!\" You are not sure what she means, but have grown to trust her judgement on imminent danger.</string>
    <string name="chp10_117_5__a">"You tell Guide how far you have come, and that wavering so shortly before your goal is foolish. But that does not seem to soothe her fears. The A'Dendri has grown more and more restless while you have talked. Finally, she Knocks to you, \"He is coming. We need to hurry.\" With that, she turns to set off. You are not sure what she means, but have grown to trust her judgement on imminent danger."</string>
    <string name="chp10_118_1a__a">"You know you are being hunted, so you have struck a fast pace. When you come to a clearing void of any signs of danger, you rest for a moment. The rain has stopped for once, and you can actually see the sky with a single ray of light breaking through the gray wall of clouds touching the ground. Maybe it is a sign from above you wonder, looking at your footprints on the soft, dark earth. Scanning the terrain, you think this could be a good place to lay some false tracks that may throw your pursuers off course, but will also cost you valuable time.


Choose one:

If you wish to spend some time to lay false tracks, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a direction to go in."</string>
    <string name="chp10_118_3a__a">While some of you walk off in the wrong direction, making sure to leave many heavy footprints, some scrap of clothing, and certain olfactory marks, the others advance slowly in a straight line, erasing their tracks after them. After a time, you congregate satisfied with your efforts.</string>
    <string name="chp10_118_4a__a">You try to lay some false tracks and cover your own, but with so many people walking around you finally make a mess out of it. Abandoning the attempt, you move on.</string>
    <string name="chp10_126_1__a">"The trees thin and become of a type you are unfamiliar with. They are still twisted and rot-eaten, some even strangled by Deepwood vines, yet they still cling to life. The stench of rotting wood and flesh enters your nose and looking around, you see hundreds of mounds litter the earth. Dead things, both A'Dendri and Deepwood of all sizes and forms. Many of them bear scratch or teeth marks. The small are trampled, the large are broken, and all show signs of fungal growth. 

To your left, a great living turret the size of The Broken Oak lies tipped on its side; its underbelly rent open. In front of it, a dozen mounds of dead meat, protruding bone and muscle give testament to its final act. To your right, packs of the slain lay scattered around a solitary figure, a female A'Dendri, bow broken and spear shattered. From their poses in death you can tell this is a battlefield and from the looks of it nobody won. You must be closing on the border or perhaps this was the border not long ago? Either way, you need to keep moving. You are losing the light, and will need to camp soon."</string>
    <string name="chp10_127_2__a">Here and there, you catch a glimpse of a shadow moving alongside you, behind the trees. Despite the fact that you have not had a good look at your pursuer, you are dead certain that you are being followed. You tell the group to pick up the pace. You need to reach your goal - and soon.</string>
    <string name="chp10_136_1__a">"A low fog is crawling in, making it impossible to see anything outside of your torchlight's radius, especially on the ground, where you suspect to walk into some bizarre trap any minute.

When darkness falls, you still press on, stumbling more than walking, clinging to hope that you will soon reach the fabled Wychwood. You ask Guide for an estimate, but she does not have a good answer. Finally, some in your party refuse to take another step, for they are too weak to go on. Your bones tell you this is a bad idea. You drive them on further, but as some begin to collapse you know you have no choice. Grudgingly, you set up camp, but make sure to double the night watch guard."</string>

You are no stranger to the market, but now you barely recognize the place. There are road blocks at every entrance, where the city guard takes a stand to keep back the crowd, letting people in only one at a time. You cannot help but notice that those that may pass are also the ones with the biggest pouches. You push through with ease, people giving you a wide berth. But as you enter, you find there is not much of a market left. Most stalls are near empty, with their vendors shrugging at you apologetically. As you look around, a feisty merchant approaches you, \"Going beyond the gate? I have just what you need. I've been waiting for a customer like you.\""</string>
    <string name="chp10_13_0__c">"As you head out, you leave the hungry crowd behind you, wondering which is the bigger threat: the plague itself, or what it makes people do. You know what those empty stalls will mean for the city. You must succeed.

She had clearly tried to relieve herself beyond the firelight and that had been when the trap sprung. One mistake is all it took, how many of those traps were out there? Both of her hands seem to be trapped in some sharp living contraption. Under it, you can see her book. She screams and you can see the violent red shine on her small, delicate fingers. One of your companions is already trying to free her while clamping a hand over her mouth. It is too late though, another sound sets in. A deep howling from the woods. With your back to the fire to protect your night vision you peer into the treeline.</string>

One of your companions is already trying to free them while clamping a hand over their mouth. It is too late though, another sound sets in. A deep howling from the woods. With your back to the fire to protect your night vision you peer into the treeline.</string>
    <string name="chp10_146_3__e">"You see the light of the fire reflected in predatory eyes fixed on you. There are beasts but no hunter, where is… an arrow blossoms from your ally's chest, ending their screams. You need to find this guy or none of you will get out of here alive."</string>
    <string name="chp10_15_0a__a">"Location 15 – Old Church

Nearing the Church, you can hear several bishops from far away. They are preaching to the masses that are kneeling on the steps, sitting on the dirty cobbles or even standing on nearby roofs for a better view. The streets are packed with people everywhere. \"God sees your strength! He knows you can overcome this trial, this plague. Cursed is the Deepwood and everything that comes from it. It seeks to devour us but we shall not let it, no! If you strengthen your pillar and keep to the path you shall not falter, shall not stray. The One wills it and his will be done!\" The crowd cheers and you feel the power of the crowd roll over you. Is this just blind hope you are witnessing or something else?

    <string name="chp10_15_1__a">"You ascend the steps to enter the church, the crowd respectfully making way. Inside the huge walls, the more well-heeled visitors are sitting more comfortably on the church benches to listen to the Archbishop's sermon. A thousand small candles are lit for the sick and dying, their flickering light illuminating the grandeur of the church's interior.

You spend some time in silent prayer and ask God's grace for a successful expedition until the Archbishop's booming voice tears you from your thoughts, \"And blessed are the brave who face the Deepwood curse without fear. Shall God have mercy on their souls.\""</string>
    <string name="chp10_15_2__a">You start a speech of your own, telling people that it is not their souls they should be worried about now, but their bodies, which are very much mortal. Being among this crowd could even be dangerous.</string>
    <string name="chp10_15_3__a">You tell them how you face the terrors of the Deepwood by fighting them. You tell them to trust in their strong arm and in each other for it is those things, not God, who will save them. People turn their faces to you, and many of them murmur in agreement. As you turn to leave, some of the crowd do so also as the bishops stare after you shaking their heads.</string>
    <string name="chp10_15_4__a">"Some people look at you curiously, but most do not want to hear about more dangers and their own mortality. It seems easier to lose themselves in the layout of the grand plan of God than to face their real world problems.

You easily find the way to the Banksmith as you have often been here. But you have never seen such a surge of customers. People have not only come here to purchase supplies, but also weapons and armor - they are truly preparing for the worst, whatever they think that is. A line of City Guards is in place to keep the masses back."</string>

A royal messenger finds you and tells you that preparations for the expedition are complete. You are expected to report to the Palace at your earliest convenience."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_11__a">"Time Triggered Story

As you cross the old stone bridge over the gutters, the Herald stops abruptly, grabbing you like a drowning man. This is the place where you first met him. His mad eyes stare into the distance, seeing something else that is not there, something terrifying.

\"One dream, two ends. In a place with none. Where the maw consumes, and shadows won. One voice, two faces. Where landless run. Beware the father. Beware the son,\" he shudders, and comes back to you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_12__a">Time Triggered Story</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_12__c">"As you enter the Palace courtyard, you find a gaggle of disparate characters checking packs and in discussion with the various servants who are helping with the final preparations for the expedition. You knew the King wanted to send others with you, but had not expected a group of academics. You doubt any have ever been in the shadow of the Deepwood. A rather stiff official greets you in full formality before launching into an introduction of the people present.

\"May I present the royal botanist, Lady Merilla, and her assistants. Their knowledge may help you in identifying and safely transporting potential cures,\" he says, then moving to the next woman. \"May I also present Lady Edith, an archivist of the third circle who shall keep a true record of events and knowledge gleaned from the Wychwood. She also has some scribes to support her task. I am certain you will find their wisdom and extensive historical knowledge quite invaluable.\"

As the official pauses to draw breath, a large man in full plate armor interjects, making sure he is being introduced properly by taking matters into his own hands.

\"I am Sir Cyprian, Knight of the Realm. For thirteen generations members of my family have served the crown. I have volunteered to protect these ladies and yourselves with my life against all horrors that might befall us on our brave expedition.\" Sir Cyprian has a few manservants and a squire with him he did not think worth mentioning."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_14__a">"Time Triggered Story

With the awkward introductions out of the way, the official then grants you access to a selection of weaponry, armor and other equipment as well as stockpiles of food. You remind everyone that you will want to travel light, so space is limited. But rations will be a necessity for everyone. Considering the road ahead, you try to gauge what you need."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_15__a">"Time Triggered Story

With preparations finally over, you look at your new entourage. Everyone seems nervous except for Sir Cyprian who is boasting of his past deeds in colorful detail. Green indeed, but not for long. You learn quickly or you die in the Deepwood. Off to the side, Guide stands quite still, her expressionless face revealing nothing of her emotions. You wonder what she thinks of returning to her homeland, when your reverie is broken by the arrival of the King, flanked by two Watchers. 

In the hands of one of the Watchers is a strange looking compass, which is handed to you. \"Wherever you go, this will point you back,\" the Watcher says with a rasp. You look at the compass curiously. Made of dark metal, richly decorated, you find instead of a needle it has a small movable vial in it filled with a thick red liquid. Strangely, it does not point north, but, instead, to the Raven Spire. 

You pocket it, making sure to secure it well as you are aware of its value - not in Iron, but for survival. As you do so, you barely notice a new member has been added to your troop. A sinewy man in close fitting leather, his face is indistinct, though he wears no mask. Your eyes slip off him as though he were just another face in the crowd. You look away, and almost forget he is there. \"Who… or what is that?\" you ask the Watcher who gave you the compass. \"An asset,\" he replies. \"You have your mission, he has his.\""</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_16__a">"Time Triggered Story

You have heard stories, infrequently uttered in the night when ale has loosened the tongue. Stories of 'Hollow Men' who operate unseen on behalf of the Watchers and answer to no one else. Back then, you had questioned the truth of these stories, like dark fairy tales, thought up only to get unruly children to behave. Now you know better."</string>

You have no idea who this new addition is, but your gut tells you things just got worse."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_18__a">"You find some clear words to describe Verum's situation and paint a vivid picture of how fast a city can fall if its guards are weakened by plague or death. You do not want to go to the Wychwood, but since when has that meant anything? You will not sit around and wait for the end, that is not your way. \"If the A'Dendri have a cure,\" you say, \"we will find it.\" 

You see agreement in most faces, and the King nods respectfully. It seems he had wanted to see how committed you were. The King glances toward a Watcher who has been standing on the opposite side of the room the whole time. Then his majesty rises, \"There shall be an expedition to the Wychwood supported by the crown. Preparations shall begin immediately.\""</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_19__a">You try to find the words to express your opinion but stumble over them. The council members begin arguing and you find it hard to cut in. You are used to fighting with weapons, not words.</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_19__c">"The meeting drags on and on, until finally you manage to interject. You explain what life is like north of the river. The body count and the fear underpinning everything the people do. The city's days are numbered. You do not want to go to the Wychwood, but since when has that meant anything? You will not sit around and wait for the end, that is not your way. \"If the A'Dendri have a cure,\" you say, \"we will find it.\"

The King considers your words, his blue eyes pierce you, seeking the right path through what you have just said. \"An expedition to the Wychwood,\" says High Captain Trent. \"It is a bold move. If they dare do it, I don't see why we shouldn't take the chance.\"

Without breaking eye contact with you, the King replies, \"Fools make an ally of chance, High Captain. Our Free Companies are our most valuable assets, they are not to be squandered, especially not this one.\""</string>

As you cross the old stone bridge over the gutters, you pass by the usual doomsayers. Unsurprisingly, their numbers seem to have grown, but the message remains the same. One of them clutches your arm as you walk by. Angrily, you turn to him with the intent to shake him off, but his grip is surprisingly firm and he stares at you intensely. \"Dark is the way and black is the mouth that knows the dreams. Beware of the darkest dream most of all for it speaks the truth!\" he shouts, before releasing you and descending into manic laughter."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_21__a">"Time Triggered Story

From what you could gather from Guide's Knock and the stories you have heard before, you have some vague idea of what you will need. You estimate that around twelve to twenty rations will be enough."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_22__a">"Time Triggered Story

You try to piece together the details of the journey ahead from what Guide has told you, but only having the Knock to communicate, you cannot be sure about the Wychwood's distance to Verum. Does she even experience time and space like you do? The only thing you do know - it is going to be a very long journey."</string>
    <string name="chp10_28_2__a">"The clerk looks up at you from his scroll, \"The King has granted you his full support for the expedition. The King wishes several specialists to join you on the journey and we need some time to assemble them and arrange what is needed. Some provisions will be provided, but the crisis will make this difficult. You can use the limited time to prepare anything additional you need for yourself - a few extra rations and a new blade wouldn't hurt,\" the clerk says, as if you had never been beyond the city gates. He is not wrong though, and you do not know what you will find on this journey. You try to ask Guide how long the journey will be, and a few knocks convey the less than helpful 'long'. Careful preparation would be wise."</string>

    <string name="chp10_3_0__c">"Escorted by the palace guard, you make your way through the city, across the bridge, passing the Cathedral, the Gutters and the Market. Everywhere people stop and turn to see you pass. Some are making signs for luck or shout blessings but a lot merely return your gaze with an empty stare. 

As you approach the King's Gate you see the way lined with barricades and enforced by armed guards. The Cobbles have been lost to the plague and its inhabitants are left to fend for themselves. The stench of death is sickening, and you quicken your pace to reach the gate.

As you walk past, you notice a large group of peasants approaching the guard line. Looking to you they cry out, \"Food for the poor!\" \"Please, my lords, help us!\" The guards become uneasy and stand their ground, weapons gripped tightly. These peasants could already be infected.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_1__a">"You call for a halt and take out some food from your backpacks. Throwing it to the crowd, making sure to aim for those with children in hand. \"A waste of good food,\" Cyprian says over your shoulder. \"They will be hungry again tomorrow.\" Ignoring the man, you move on knowing if people lose their humanity to this plague, there'll be nothing left worth saving."</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_1__c">"You continue along the road until you reach the King's Gate. The Captain of the Palace Guard wishes you good fortune, takes his men and returns the way you came. You take a last look at the city of Verum before stepping onto the Wire Road while the gates close behind you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_2__a">"It is not this small crowd you need to save, it is everyone. Anything that jeopardizes that cannot enter your mind. So you avert your eyes and press on until you hear a metallic clang to one side. A stone has been thrown in your direction and others follow. \"Shields up!\" commands the Captain of the Palace Guards. The crowd are shouting curses at you and more and more try to break the line of City Guards. Mad with hunger and desperation. If they break through, out of quarantine, the plague could spread rapidly through other parts of the city.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_3__a">"You order the Palace Guard to quickly bring your allies safely to the King's Gate while you hold the line with the City Guardsmen. The quarantine must not be broken."</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_3__c">"Strengthened by your support, the City Guard makes an effort to put down the rebellion fast. The fight is short but frantic. Although they were larger in numbers, they were unarmed, exposed and weakened by sickness or hunger. After the situation is under control, you watch the survivors drag themselves away and ponder how this plague is making animals out of everyone. It needs to stop.

You quickly make your way to the Kings Gate to reunite with your expedition members. The Captain of the Palace Guard wishes you good fortune, takes his men and returns the way you came. You take a last look at the city of Verum before stepping onto the Wire Road while the gates close behind you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_4__a">"\"Run!\" you shout, and everyone hastens away toward the city's edge. Behind you, you hear the shouts of soldiers, and finally the sounds of combat. The Palace Guards keep their shields up, protecting your left and rear side to cover your retreat."</string>
    <string name="chp10_3_4__c">"At the King's Gate, the Captain of the Palace Guard hastily wishes you good fortune and creates a defensive semi-circle around the gate. You take a last look at the city of Verum before stepping onto the Wire Road while the gates close behind you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_0__a">"From Guide's description, you know that the Wychwood lies roughly north of Verum, so you can spend at least the first few days on the Wire Road. You make sure that your new allies know the rules out here. Always keep one hand on the wire. Stay silent and stay together. The archivists and botanists do not seem to be a problem, but you catch the knight, more often than not, with a lack of caution boasting he is 'not afraid of monsters'. You know he had better be. Like you, Guide has been here before. Outside the city, she has discarded her clothes to be better able to blend into the woods, occasionally acting as your scout. As you advance, you constantly scan the trees on either side of the road, carefully observing the murky, ever-shifting shadows of the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_0__c">After your first days of the journey, the Wire Road takes a turn to the right. You consult Guide and she conveys that it is time to leave the road, and continue north.</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_10__a">"You ask her for the city's name but she shakes her head, \"Lost to time,\" she says. \"So close to the Wire Road yet we never knew it was here.\"

\"This is the way of the woods,\" you reply. No one knows how many are lost out here. How much knowledge, how many treasures of the old world. You have even heard fablemen spinning yarns of peoples still living beneath lost cities lit only by the glint of their mountains of gold. Fairy tales, yet alluring enough to put fire in the belly of some young men and women who leave the city each season never to be seen again. Looking at the overgrown structures, you can feel the allure yourself, but shake off the thought. You have a job to do.

With the day drawing to an end, you camp in the lee of a great stone wall."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_1__a">"You let go of the hard metal wire and step into the twilight of the crooked trees. The familiar sick, moldy damp of the Deepwood fills your nostrils and one of your allies sneezes loudly. A low rustling in the dark undergrowth. A hiss somewhere above you in the unnaturally brown-purple canopy. The Deepwood knows of your presence. It is almost as if it is waiting for you to venture deeper into its territory. But Guide seems certain of the direction she is taking you, so you follow her. Her lithe form moving gracefully among the trees.

Not long after, you come across some large, overgrown stones that seem manmade. Vegetation to your right seems less thick, and you can see farther than usual. As you peer past remnants of a thick wall, completely overgrown with long, tendril-like vines, you realize you are at the edge of an ancient city, long lost to the Deepwood. A ghost of Verum's future, should you fail."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_1__c">"Edith, the archivist, scribbles her findings with deep concentration as she stares at the city. It is the calmest you have seen her since you left Verum. However, you know that you need to continue to move.

    <string name="chp10_40_2__a">"As it becomes clear that Cyprian will not receive a ration, you see anger flare up in the knight's eyes for an instant, but he has it under control. Shortly after, you see him walking around the camp telling everyone how he has made a sacrifice, and now suffers for the weak but is strong enough to take it."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_3__a">"The next morning, as everyone leaves camp to continue your journey, one of the scribes shyly approaches you. He is usually sweet and funny, but his look is dark this morning. \"It's Lady Edith. We can't get her to move,\" he faintly gestures toward the camp. The archivist is sitting on a tree trunk, and with a shaky hand writes in the book she always keeps on her person. The other scribe is crouching beside her, seemingly trying to talk sense into her, his eyes glittering with tears. You stride over, telling her it is time to go, but she just continues to write without looking up, waving you away as if you are distracting her from important work and mumbling, \"Need to record it… so many horrors… they need to know…\" She is obviously unwell.

    <string name="chp10_40_8__a">"Merilla's spirits seem unaffected by your decision to withhold food from them. She even tells you that they have brought some rats from Verum, not for eating them - she hurries to add - but for experimentation. She has seen some berries and other fruits near the camp that they recognize from their books and are pretty sure to be edible. As you open your mouth to argue, she promises to not take any risks and strolls off. 

But only a short while later, you hear cries from the camp's edge and hurry to see the botanists jumping around after the rats that have somehow escaped their cage and are running for freedom. You try to catch at least some of them for a potential dinner, but they are fast and some of you even get bitten by the furry beasts. Eventually, you end up with a bunch of dead rats twitching in death pain and botanists with long faces. All the rats that you caught have already eaten the poisonous Deepwood fruits."</string>
    <string name="chp10_40_9__a">You travel onward, always north, until you come across a huge hollow tree that looks different from the usual Deepwood sort. You also notice it is unnaturally quiet here, something that is every bit as much a reason to expect trouble as sudden sounds. Without warning, something jumps down in front of you. It is Guide. \"Homeland… here,\" she tells you in the Knock. As she makes her sounds and signals, small spores drift from Guide and settle on your skin. You suddenly feel a great sense of loss overcome you. \"Long ago, never again,\" she signals and turns north.</string>
    <string name="chp10_4_0__a">"Location 4 - The Greenstreets

You come to the entrance of the Green Streets where the mud and mortar give way to mossy ground and vine covered buildings. To your surprise you find a makeshift field hospital setup where a number of people lay on the soft, mossy ground. The A'Dendri present treat them with mushed herbs and pulses in an attempt to slow the obvious infection that reveals itself in black veins that creep across their bodies. 

Noticing you, a male A'Dendri with a crest of bark antlers approaches. Guide releases a fine mist of spores from her hair toward the newcomer and an unspoken exchange takes place. Already proving her worth, Guide taps out an explanation in the Knock. It appears the A'Dendri are immune to the plague so they are doing what they can to help. Few will accept their aid though. Tensions have always been high between humans and A'Dendri, and the fact that the A'Dendri are not seen to suffer along with the rest of the populace has not made that any better. 

With nothing more to be gained here you go to leave, but as you do the male stops you with a gesture. Without any communication you could see, two A'Dendri appear from houses and hold out an armful of provisions. It seems the communication with Guide has gone both ways and they know where you are going. With thanks, you accept the gifts."</string>
    <string name="chp10_64_1a__a">"You walk past a large, bent tree that somehow catches your attention. You approach the tree and see its bark is warped into what looks like a humanoid figure. As you lean closer to inspect the detail, an eye opens in the head-like shape of the tree. It is not human, but an A'Dendri! Guide recoils. A fine mist of spores emanate from the figure bound to the tree. Some land on you and a sense of despair not your own crawls up your spine. Guide turns to you, \"She and the tree are one, suffering. Kill tree, end pain?\" The ancient A'Dendri is slowly, gradually being consumed by the Deepwood. Trapped here forever.

But finally, the hungry flames start licking the tree's skin and as it goes up in flame, the eye looks at you one last time before closing. With the smoke rising up, you see a flood of spores also being released and an intense feeling of thankfulness and relief overcomes you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_65_1a__a">"You walk on, in the direction indicated by Guide who is scouting ahead again. She usually does not stray far from the group, returning frequently to adjust course. You keep the other expedition members close by, taking care to have capable fighters near those who are most vulnerable, especially in the front and rear.

As always, you cross the Deepwood at your utmost alertness. Every plant can mean death if you are not careful. Consequently, as you hear the snap of a twig on your right, your hand seeks your weapon almost instinctively. A clearing lies ahead of you. You enter, all senses sharp, looking all around. Then you hear a low growl, almost inaudible, behind you. You spin around, scanning the tree-line, and spot something moving. It is almost invisible among the trees, much like an A'Dendri. It even seems to be made of the same material. But in its shape, it is clearly an animal on four feet. Weapons drawn, you advance slowly toward it, trying to make out what it is. A dog? No, a great hound, and it charges at you with snapping fangs!"</string>
    <string name="chp10_65_2__c">"Sir Cyprian proves to be valuable in this fight as the creature's fangs struggle to find purchase on the plates of his armor. Together, you bring it down."</string>
    <string name="chp10_65_3__c">The creature is fast as lightning and its fangs are razor-sharp, but finally you bring it down.</string>
    <string name="chp10_65_5__a">The hound is defeated, but still alive. It lays on the ground, twitching. You have never seen something like it in the Deepwood. As you look at it, you notice to your horror that it starts to regrow, healing itself. \"Amber, quick!\" someone urges, and you hasten to strike a spark and set fire to it. The wooden creature writhes and whines as flames devour its body until it turns into ash. In the distance, a shrill sound echoes through the Deepwood as if in answer.</string>
    <string name="chp10_65_5__c">"Guide, returning from the woods, takes a look at the half burnt creature. Its shape and material are still recognizable, and her eyes go wide. Her Knock tells you, \"A'Dendri made this. Should not be here.\""</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_0__a">"Location 6 - The Apothecary

You head over to the apothecary only to find the way barred by a pair of guards. A crowd is gathered loosely around the shop and shout at the guards to let them be seen by the apothecary. The guards are unmoved by the pleas of the crowd who are clearly fearful to come within arm's reach of the heavy cudgels that await them at the door. The city's cryers had issued a warning that the apothecaries had no cure for the plague, yet that did not stop people from flocking to their doors believing they had a miracle stowed away inside.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_3__a">"You have no time to do the guards' job for them. The crowd parts for you as you approach, and the guards stand aside, nodding respectfully. It seems there is one upside to being known as the 'Heroes of Bastone'. Entering, brother Lax greets you."</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_4__a">"If they are afraid of cudgels, they are terrified of you. Your stare is enough to send the crowd packing and the guards smile as you approach. Without further ado, you are granted access to the apothecary. \"Thank you,\" brother Lax says as you enter. \"I've not been able to think straight with all their yelling. Please let me repay my debt. A discount on anything you wish."</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_5__a">"Your threats only make the crowd angrier, several even throw stones at you. Without thinking, you enter combat readiness.

    <string name="chp10_6_6__a">By the Pact, the moment they raised a weapon against you their lives were forfeit.</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_6__c">"So much for a house of healing. Several bodies lay on the ground as the rest scatter in the face of your seasoned blows. Dying over a cure that doesn't exist. What is this city coming to? 

Seeing your grim faces the guards think better than to try to deny you entry. Inside, brother Lax greets you with a shaky voice. He saw what happened, and although he seems relieved the crowd is gone, he seems more worried you have stayed."</string>
    <string name="chp10_6_7__a">"You know better than to start slaying civilians in the streets of Verum. Although one of you has taken a hit from a stone, the city is an amber bomb and it won't take much to set it off. Flashing your Oathmarks to the guards, you push past, leaving them to deal with the crowd."</string>
    <string name="chp10_76_1__c">At one point, Guide suddenly stops you. She moves forward slowly, carefully, almost at a crouch. \"Old homeland defenses,\" she knocks, \"Not active.\" You draw closer and look at the strange plant formations protruding from the ground. They are natural plant material, but it is obvious that no plants grow like this. Guide tries to tell you more, but it is too complex.</string>
    <string name="chp10_76_2__a">"You just about keep up with what Guide is trying to communicate. These \"sentries\" seem to have been some kind of defensive fortification of the A'Dendri. You are moving through territory that was part of the Wychwood a long time ago and has since been taken over by the Deepwood. Guide tells you this land was once ruled by a great king, the memory of him consumed by the Deepwood, along with his kingdom. She closes with, \"The land is lost. The battle continues.\" You think of the hound-like creature that attacked you and the shriek you heard. Something tells you that you have now become part of this battle… and that you are being followed."</string>
    <string name="chp10_76_3__a">"Guide's Knock is too hard for you to understand properly. She talks about the Wychwood and something about a past king. Much to the regret of Edith, her history lesson is lost on you."</string>

Eventually you manage to free them, but you can see small puncture wounds everywhere the vines hit skin.

Moments like these are important, but raising spirits won't help get rid of this killer plague. You continue talking amongst yourselves, until you hear the door open and all talk and movement around you dies down."</string>
    <string name="chp10_7_12__a">"Greycane is only too happy to oblige, and tells the story of the 'Rogue and the Royal', where some horrific plague of ages past could only be cured by a usurped Queen and the scoundrel who helped her escape. The people seem to find some solace in the idea that there may have been other plagues that were eventually overcome. Just as Greycane is wrapping up his epic tale, the door to The Broken Oak opens and all eyes turn toward it."</string>
    <string name="chp10_7_15__a">"The silhouette of a hooded figure is visible against the morning sun, lingering on the doorstep, seemingly hesitant to enter. Then it silently steps into the amber-lit room. There are a few gasps and murmurs. This is no ordinary visitor. Piercing eyes from a green-skinned, mouthless face find you in an instant. She pulls back her hood and reveals, instead of hair, long vines growing from her head, entangled in an elaborate braid. An A'Dendri.

Greycane finally breaks the spell and motions her closer. \"Heroes of Bastone,\" he says with a wink. \"I would like to introduce you to a friend of mine. She has helped me find more than a few things since we have been here and what she lacks in words she makes up for in eyes.\" Turning to the A'Dendri, he makes swift hand motions in 'The Knock'. You know enough of it to communicate the basics, but find it hard to follow Greycane's rapid clicking, clapping, and gesturing. He seems to have a vast treasury of words in any language. The A'Dendri knocks in reply and you can discern she has an 'offer' she wants to bring before the 'leader with the hat'. From past interaction, you know this to mean the King. 

Greycane takes over the translation, \"She says word of the Mendicants has reached the Green Streets. The A'Dendri know what many in this city think of them. They are scorned and hated, yet this is their home too. They wish to help. She says if anyone can save the city now, it will be those in her homeland. They know more of the ways of nature than anyone. She is offering to take you to the fabled Wychwood.\" Taken aback you look more closely at the female. You know what it means for any A'Dendri to want to return to that place. Those that call the Green Streets home arrived as refugees from the Wychwood and although you do not know exactly what happened there, whatever it was, it was bad enough to risk the Deepwood to escape it. 

No one has ever been to the Wychwood and returned to tell the tale, yet still tales have arisen. Its very name is a derivation of the word Witch, men with a belly full of ale concoct fabulous stories of its horrors. You have no wish to go there, yet everyone loses if the plague wins, and right now you are out of cards to play. You exchange knowing glances with each other. Ultimately, it won't be your decision, the King will need to hear this. Rising from the table to prepare to head to the palace, you ask what you are to call the A'Dendri and you get a single gesture in reply, \"Guide\"."</string>

The news of the Mendicants is the talk of the city. \"Good morning,\" Greycane calls, the only smiling face you see in the room. \"Bram's been working on a new recipe for wall plaster.\"

\"It's not plaster, it's porridge, and it didn't stop you eating two bowls!\" Bram retorts, turning his nose up to Greycane.

\"Looks like I'm not the only one who rebuffs your cooking old boy,\" Greycane says nodding to Quintus. The fully armored adjutant sits bent over in the corner, staring intensely into his full bowl of porridge. You can see it's not the food that gives him pause.

Joining him you ask what is wrong. \"I have failed them. They were my charge… and I was found wanting. Did I sin? I must have sinned or this would not have happened. I should go back to Cistercia to be back in the light of the church, to do penance.\"

Opening your chamber door, still a bit drowsy, you come to a dead stop. A giant towers inches before you, staring at you motionless: the Golem. You had forgotten about it, but there it is where you left it, having been ordered to stand guard. You command it to move, but it stares at you unblinkingly. You prepare to shout at the thing, then remember. Cursing under your breath, you collect the control rod and gripping it in your hand direct the thing again. This time it moves. You start to think, you may not so much have gained a tool as lost a hand."</string>

With those words he leaves you in the Oak. You doubt you will see him again. It is a shame, he had a good swing.

A skeleton of a tent, with its cloth torn and tattered, flaps ghostly in the wind. A dark circle of stones, its ashes long since cold and scattered.

You walk among the sickly trees, their branches grasping for you like skeletal fingers, the pale fungus on them, like bulging eyes always watching you. Then you stop, the route ahead is blocked by a field of cysts. 

Merilla comes to your side, looking at them curiously, \"Are they plants or animals? It appears to be something in-between. How peculiar, how absolutely fascinating!\" You tell her she does not want to know and turn to discuss alternate routes with Guide.

As you do so, Cyprian yells, \"What's the delay? I do not agree to discuss every single disgusting object we encounter when we could simply cut our way through!\" He turns to his manservant, \"Rupert, make yourself useful!\"

Before you can stop him, the manservant runs toward the cyst, sword in hand. A step before he reaches it the cyst quivers, disgorging its contents all over the man. Reeling away from the cyst, Rupert coughs violently. It is already too late. He has inhaled the spores.

You know what you must do.

You order everyone to stand back and close on Rupert in a guarded stance. Rupert's eyes grow large in realization of what this means. He begins to plead, but your steps do not slow. One swift motion and you behead the man, killing him instantly. There are gasps of shock, but you need no words to justify your actions. You shoot a disgusted look at Cyprian. The guilt he should feel is clearly absent from his face, \"You are unfit to lead this expedition,\" he says to you, \"It is your place to warn me of danger, his death is on your head.\""</string>

As Rupert staggers, you explain to Cyprian what will happen if you let the man live. Without a second thought, the knight draws his sword and walks toward his servant. He buries his sword deep into Rupert's belly. Shocked, the man stares at him and sinks to his knees in pain, holding his stomach as though holding in his life. Cyprian stands over him, unmoved. \"Fool, now I will have to manage without you.\" As Rupert draws his last rasping breaths, you shoot a disgusted look at Cyprian.

There is no way you are going to let that happen. You know his sort, you would be dead within days. You also know how to deal with them."</string>

You leave out none of the gory details. You let him know how he had better get back in line, walk where you tread, and pipe down or any one of those fates will be his. 

Shocked at being talked to like that, Cyprian is on his back foot. For a moment, he looks like he will draw his sword, but looking at you, thinks better of it. Retreating, he cuffs one of his manservants for being slow and gets back in line.

You lay back on your bedroll, having oiled and sharpened your weapons. On the verge of sleep, you hear Cyprian and his squire talk. You know they have the first night watch. From their argument, you can deduce that the boy is questioning an order to guard outside the firelight at the edge of camp, the notion is a sensible one. You open your eyes just in time to see the knight raise his hand to strike his squire, the fire reflecting on the polished steel of his heavy gauntlet.

You shout. Surprised, the knight turns to you. You stride toward them, with a curse on your lips and a command to stand down. The knight does not wait for you to finish the sentence. His hand comes hard across the boy's face, \"He should follow orders!\" The squire falls down and gingerly touches the cut on his head where blood is beginning to well out. You shoot Cyprian a furious look and extend a hand to help his squire up. 

Tears brim in the boy's eyes as he takes your hand, \"I will take the Oath!\" he says. Everyone falls silent for a moment, respectfully taking in his momentous decision. \"You know what that means?\" you ask. \"I do, better than dying at his hands.'' You cannot argue with that logic and let Cyprian know that this puts the boy under immediate protection from your Free Company and that he is obliged to free Willem from his service. 

Through gritted teeth, the knight utters, \"This is the thanks I get for my patronage, you're a fool, boy.\" He looks at you, about to say more, but he knows as well as anyone that once the words are out, there will be no taking them back."</string>

Edith is sitting on the ground, wrapped in a blanket, paging through her book. You go over to invite her to join in, but she shakes her head. \"I just need to be alone for awhile. I am not used to being around people all the time, let alone outside the city walls, without any privacy. I never wanted this, I was ordered to accompany you on this ordeal of a journey.\" She sounds exhausted and you decide better leave her to herself as requested. 

As you turn away, you hear her mutter something below her breath. \"Even the Deepwood is watching me. I know it.\" You pause for a moment and look at her, but she is lost in her book again.

Your foremost responsibility is to ensure the mission's success. The fact it is one of your own in that tree does not change that. How many bodies lay on the other side of the choice to save them? Whoever is out there wants you to try. No, you cannot risk it. You give the order to run while your ally screams for their life up in the tree. Moments later, it is silenced by the thud of an arrow. You try to take solace in the fact it could have been a lot worse."</string>

You have all been through a lot to get this far. You will leave no one behind. Your quickest climber makes their way up the tree, pulls your ally in and starts to cut them loose from the trap. The sound of a bowstring hums and an arrow shoots past them, embedding its sharp head into the tree stem inches beside them. You turn to see where it came from, but more arrows start flying toward you."</string>
    <string name="chp10m_c_2__c">As you try to take cover, you cannot see your attacker or make out how many there are. You keep your eyes trained for incoming arrows and even deflect a few from striking your downed ally. Finally you get them down, and bolt for the cover of the trees. No footsteps follow. Your hunter got what they wanted.</string>
    <string name="chp11_0_1__a">"You stare at the tips of two dozen arrowheads trained on you. Before you could enact judgement on the 'Forgotten King', the A'Dendri had emerged from the trees before your eyes. Guide dashes between you and her kin, wildly releasing spores toward the A'Dendri and motioning, \"Calm!\" to you. You wait, hands on your weapons, ready while they communicate in total silence. Finally, the Rangers lower their bows. Guide Knocks, \"Agreement. To Matriarch. We go.\" You let out a sigh of relief and lower your weapons as well. The alternative could have easily meant your death. If your luck holds, you may find a cure for the plague in Verum here. As the group of A'Dendri ushers you forward in the first light of the new day, the Forgotten King stands defiant. He makes no move as you are motioned toward the Wychwood."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_11__a">"You had not expected A'Dendri to be at war with one another in their own land. Without more information you cannot make the call one way or another and instead draw back to back in a defensive position. Moments later arrows start to fly, many finding their mark among your guards. In reply the Rangers leap into action sending return volleys up into the trees. You observe the fury of nature unbound as graceful forms leap on one another wielding amber blades in deadly arcs. The exchange is bloody and without mercy. To your amazement, neither side focuses on you, and you even get the impression they are actively avoiding you to keep you safe. The combat is close fought with both sides looking able to take the field."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_13__a">"The last arrow flies, embedding itself in the chest of one of your captors, and you find yourself alone in a field of the dead. Both sides took total losses and although the Resistance had the element of surprise, the Rangers had picked them off from afar and butchered them at close quarters. Man for man, clearly the greater warriors. They had wiped each other out, and for what? 

You search the bodies of the dead to find some answers and discover a single Resistance A'Dendri still alive. Guide rushes to their side and gentle spores drift to the prone figure as though afraid to cause harm. The dying A'Dendri's eyes open and with intense concentration a single spore is sent in reply. \"They do for us,\" she conveys. At some unseen signal from the A'Dendri, Guide reaches out a hand and takes a small receptacle made out of weeds from beside the warrior. As she raises it, it unfurls to reveal a number of mushrooms, black with white fringes. You look back to the wounded female and see the same mushrooms attached to her now still body. She has passed away. 

You ask Guide what she knows and she answers with something that translates to, \"We all want same. Be free.\" She looks up at you, eyes wide, and relates the last message from the A'Dendri, \"Find Mother, they say.\" Seeing as you do not know what her Knock means, she goes on explaining, \"All-mother. Oldest. Wisest. Hidden.\" Then she points to the mushrooms. \"Take in, eat.\" She struggles with the next hand signals, \"Change you? New you?\" She offers you the mushrooms."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_1__a">"Led by the A'Dendri Rangers, you cross the no man's land between the Deepwood and the Wychwood. The area is strewn with the bodies of monstrous aberrations, riddled with arrows and giant bioform constructs, torn apart. Your eyes are drawn from the carnage of the battlefield to the awe inspiring sight of your destination, the Wychwood.

Before you, a high wall of green stretches to both sides as far as you can see. On your approach, a path opens and lets you enter into what seems a different world. Turning back, for a brief moment you see Samil standing there with a sad smile, before the wall grows to close behind you.

You are surrounded by plant life in a confusing array of colors and smells so dense that it overwhelms your senses. The trees stand strong, their bark of an earthy color. Unmolested by Deepwood rot, they are covered in moss and full of green leaves that drip with last night's rain. The air smells clean and flowery and you take deep breaths to fill your lungs. You feel your bodies relax involuntarily, as if remembering a time long gone when humans would find something other than death outside their settlements. You stifle the relaxation knowing the danger that lies behind the beauty here. This 'Matriarch' of the A'Dendri is unknown to you, and so are the ways of this wood.

You exchange glances and wonder if you could fight your way out of here if need be. It is in this very moment that you realize the 'asset' is no longer with you. When did you last see them?"</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_2__a">"As the Rangers lead you deeper into the Wychwood, you study the immensity of the trees around you. Gazing upward, you suddenly stare into a pair of eyes looking right back at you. Barely visible through the abundance of leaves in the canopy above, you make out a number of A'Dendri hiding up there – with bowstrings drawn tight. The hidden A'Dendri obviously know you have seen them, but just continue to look at you. A chill grips you, and you feel your reaction will be of grave importance. This sure looks like an ambush, but could just as well mean your rescue. You look to Guide. Her hand signal tells you, \"A'Dendri Resistance.\" You have only a moment to decide if you want to take sides in a conflict you did not know existed until now."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_3__a">"Someone shouts, \"Ambush!\" and you prepare to fight. Your Ranger guards turn to you in alarm, unaware of your intention, some even raising their bows to take aim at you again. Guide – with what seems like hesitation to you – lets out her spores to translate. They react immediately. Some climb the trees with ease, others vanish into the undergrowth while a few take up defensive positions near your group.

You will not endanger your mission by helping some rogue group you know nothing about. On the contrary, this ambush presents a golden opportunity to show your captors you are on the same side, and a worthy ally. Then arrows start to fly."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_4__a">"Your gut feeling has saved you many times and it is telling you now that something is not right with your captors. You will take whatever opportunity arises to get rid of them – and this is it. You nod to the A'Dendri in the canopy and secretly exchange glances with each member of your Free Company. Everyone knows who they will take first. 

Your captors did not see this coming. As most of them are hit by arrows from above, simultaneously you attack from behind. You did not like being taken in like criminals by them or how they were looking at you. You think the A'Dendri of the Resistance will be more forthcoming after you have shown your worth as an ally in this fight."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_5__a">"The Resistance fighters are defeated, but not without cost. You see some of your captors lying motionless on the ground. As you are prompted to move on by a Ranger, you are surprised to witness that they just leave their own there in the dirt without showing any sign of grief. You have a lot of questions but this is not the time or place to discuss them.

As your group is led deeper into the Wychwood, you come to a clearing where about fifty young A'Dendri Rangers are standing in unnaturally straight rows, totally unmoving. You are just passing them in eerie silence, when the ground begins to shake. An A'Dendri is approaching, larger than any of his race you have seen before. He is at least thrice the height of a human, and heavily armored with what appears to be hard pieces of wood and bark grown over his whole body. Long strides take him to the lines of unmoving Rangers, and he releases a flood of spores to all of them. In an instant, the whole clearing is brimming with life. All except your guards withdraw their roots from the ground to quickly move into something that looks like bushes to you… until it stands up. The behemoth consists entirely of living wood, looking like a massive tree with five thick trunks. Under the control of the A'Dendri, the bioconstruct moves toward the Deepwood border, transporting the Rangers between its branches. You wonder if it goes to reinforce the border after the ambush, as the heavy tread of trunklike feet follows long after the behemoth is out of sight."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_6__a">"You do not know if you have grown too used to taking risks or if it is Guide staring at you intensely, wanting you to do it. But somehow, you each decide to eat a mushroom.

At first, nothing happens other than you feeling a numbness on your tongues and a growling in your bellies. Then the world becomes very intense. You cannot remember lying down, but the sky is now before you. Or did it move there somehow? You try to explain to yourself why that should not be possible – and fail. It is hard to concentrate, because the whole wood is screaming at you, \"TREEKILLER! TREEKILLER! TREEKILLER!\", in a deafening roar. Then something else distracts you. An animal is walking over you with its long bony legs, sniffing you, searching for something. But this is wrong, because it does not have a face and its body is made out of branches. Finally, the wood's anger seems to subside, its strange voices slowly fading to silence. The trees are crying now, their tears blind you and wash away the confusion.

Slowly, the world goes back to normal. There was more going on earlier, but you have forgotten most of it. Was that a dream? You shake each other back to reality. What were you thinking? You are alone in an alien place full of A'Dendri that may now consider you their enemy. You need to come to your senses and come up with a plan."</string>
    <string name="chp11_1_7__c">"Eating unknown things in the Deepwood gets you killed. You doubt things are much different here. You decline Guide. Here, you are in an alien place full of A'Dendri that might now consider you their enemy. You need to keep your senses sharp and come up with a plan.

Guide tries to persuade you, and gestures to her non-existent mouth but you won't have any of it. Instead, you take the receptacle and the mushrooms from her and tuck them away in a backpack. It is time you move away from the dead bodies before someone comes looking for them."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_1__c">"You wake with a headache. As you look around, you find yourselves at the edge of the Wychwood outside the wall of green. You have no idea how you got here, or how much of what you saw in there was real. It is hard to remember most of it, but the last image has left an indelible mark on your mind. At odds with the nature of the image, as you were sucked into that black abyss just before the end, you felt a strange certainty. You felt hope. 

You still do not have what you came here for, no cure for the plague. But after your encounter with the A'Dendri you are certain answers lie within that cave. You begin to consider how you might find it, when you realize you know exactly where it is. As though a beacon shone through the gloom of the Deepwood, you can sense the direction it lies in."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_2__a">"You press on for days in the direction of the cave, the Deepwood getting thicker with every furlong. No Free Company you know of has ever delved so deep into the woods before. For hundreds of years, archivists have tried to chart the woods to gain some semblance of understanding of its bounds and reach. All expeditions came up short with the same answer - 'The Deepwood continues on forever.' Now you head to a place no one knew existed, the Deepwood's center."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_2__c">"As the trees become denser, the light fades away, and you feel the unease of the party. Guide in particular seems nervous. When asked about it, she signals, \"She gave warning. Stay in light. Beware of shadow.\" Noting the amount of shadows all around, you take stock of your amber torches and lanterns. You could light your path enough to see you to the cave and back again if you are careful. It would bolster morale and perhaps fend off whatever Guide is talking about, but light might just as well attract unwanted attention. You could alternatively take it slow in the dark and be on guard for the hidden threat, making sure not to signpost your presence here.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_3__a">"Heeding Guide's words, you light an amber torch. Grimly you mumble part of the Oath, \"We are the last line, the line of the glorious dead. We shall not break.\" You know there is no choice but to go on, but the warm light emanating from your torch makes your fear of the unknown bearable. You resolve to keep one burning at all times. The strong glow and slow burn will keep the area around you illuminated for hours."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_3__c">Your concerns of drawing attention were correct however, and not long after a pack of tentacle-faced creatures with scything talons descends upon you.</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_3__e">Wiping the blood from your blades, you feel you are drawing close to your goal.</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_4__a">Dropping your pace, you signal everyone to alertness. Holding this level of attention is exhausting and takes discipline but is necessary to ensure nothing sneaks up on you.</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_4__c">It takes time, but eventually you feel you are drawing close to your goal.</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_5__a">"You push on through thorns and clamber over thick roots. You can barely breathe the cloying air, and darkness is everywhere. You have never seen the Deepwood like this before. The trees seem to pulse and ooze amber ichor, and cysts dot the land like pustules on a bloated corpse. Before you, the ground abruptly drops away, and the view opens up onto a large ravine. Gaping in the mountainside like a dark, festering wound is the cave from your vision. A fifty foot gash cleft into the rock. You instantly know that you have reached your destination, the Deepwood's center. You have arrived at the Heart of Darkness."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_6__a">An overriding sense of vileness washes over you as you look into that darkness, and it is almost enough to make you miss the immediate danger. The place is crawling with Deepwood monstrosities, the likes of which you have never seen before. A sea of fur and fangs, chitin and claws, flow around the cave as if maggots crawling around a cadaver. Fear and anger grip you at the sight of the certain death awaiting you at the mouth of the cave. You will never get in there like this. But you are so close. You know the answer lies within that cave. Did you travel all this way for nothing? You have no time to consider the question as you feel something coming.</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_6__c">"A familiar deep thumping in the earth draws your attention. You remember that feeling from… You tense, gripping your weapons tight at a crashing sound. Off to your right trees bend, creak and crack, and the stuff of nightmares claws its way into reality before you.

The giant beast, in storm gray armor, is larger than a townhouse and shrouded in deadly fumes. Uprooting a tree whole, it barrels toward you. The Doom of Bastone! Whatever else you had planned, you are now left with only one choice - you must run for your life."</string>
    <string name="chp11_20_7__a">"As you set out once more under the swollen canopy of the Deepwood you realize how sick this place is. You feel stifled by the thick air and the ever present smell of rot, a stark contrast to the sweet breeze of the Wychwood. You feel remorse that you may never see it again. Your reverie is broken as you sense Samil's eyes on you. The apparition or whatever he is, is waiting for you, sitting on a dead trunk. He looks at you as though trying to figure something out. On your approach, he gets up, smiles, and walks off in the direction of the cave - fading to nothing."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_10__a">"As you make your way across the battlefield, looting what you can, you notice something strange. The shadows cast by the dead are lengthening before your eyes. The last few rays of sunlight are receding from the area, but these shadows are pressing in too fast, and seem to reach out like hands. Hurriedly you call for everyone to gather together in a patch of light between the mounds of the dead and prepare torches. Guide is at the back, running for the light when you see what looks like the shadow of a man crawl along the earth. It reaches out to her and… immediately she stops. Her body goes limp for a moment and then, as though a puppet on strings, her head rolls up and her body begins to jerk. Around you, you see the shadows start to crawl across the space, heading straight for you. You strike your torches and the shadows recoil from where the light lands. This does not deter Guide though, who steps into the light, her eyes black pits as cold as the grave.

Arms raised she charges to attack you. She strikes you with a force that belies her size. You ward off the attack, though the blow nearly breaks your arm.

    <string name="chp11_21_11__a">This is not her, no one is this strong. You shout at her to stop, but she comes forward again, seemingly gaining strength with every moment. She strikes at you, and this time one of your companions takes the blow in your stead.</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_11__c">"You do not think you will survive much more of this. While you wrestle with her, there is a brief moment of cognition as she seems to wrestle with herself too. She makes strange clicking sounds. Suddenly you realize it is the Knock. She is signaling you two words over and over, \"Kill me, kill me…\"

Left with no choice, you run her through."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_12__a">You do not think you can survive another blow like that. She comes forward again, seemingly gaining strength with every moment. Left with no choice, you run her through.</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_16__c">"\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Willem's shriek of grief pierces the night. You did not realize how close they were until now. As Guide's body goes limp, he rushes forward and catches her in his arms to lay her down gently, \"She risked her life for you, and you killed her!\" He throws a punch at you, angry tears in his eyes."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_17__c">"Guide's body goes limp and you catch her in your arms to lay her down gently. She risked her life by returning to the woods, only to be slain by you."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_18__a">"You see the rest of the creeping shadows, a cloak of darkness crawling across the ground pressing in at the edge of the light. You brace yourselves and raise the last of your torches, then a hand with unnaturally long fingers reaches out from Guide's shadow and grabs you."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_1__a">"You run as fast as your legs allow, slashing your way through the Deepwood like madmen. If you die now, all that has happened since you left Verum will be for nothing. The knowledge that you have gained, the hope for a cure will be lost.

Vines strike your face as thorns cut your clothes but you only feel the shaking of the ground as the Doom of Bastone thunders behind you. Nightmarish creatures scream at you, but you only hear the deafening roar and the trees bursting into splinters as the beast crashes through the Deepwood. Memories flash before your inner eye - the broken city wall, streets exploding into dusty ruins, Lord Davenish vanishing into a crimson mist with one stroke of the beast's claws. And the awful cries of the people that have haunted you since.

You risk a look over your shoulder. The Doom of Bastone is gaining on you fast, yellowish smoke billowing from its nostrils, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Behind you, some of your allies are having a hard time keeping pace."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_1__c">If you:</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_2__c">You are far from civilization, and to waste an opportunity like that to bolster your arms would be foolish. As you search for useful items, Guide just stands there, her watchful eyes fixed on the shadows. Without shifting her gaze she signals, \"She warn me. Leave now.\"</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_3__a">You do not want to stay in this place longer than necessary, but if you can bolster your arms this easily, you will. As you grab a few pieces, Guide just stands there, her watchful eyes fixed on the shadows. Without shifting her gaze she signals, \"She warn me. Leave now.\"</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_4__a">You feel the unnatural cold bite at your ankles, while the dead lay there staring into the darkness where they fell hundreds of years ago. You see Guide standing there, her watchful eyes fixed on the shadows. Without shifting her gaze she signals, \"She warn me. Leave now.\" You agree and make for the treeline. On your way, you hastily grab something you find on the ground.</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_5__a">"You know this place. You know it because the A'Dendri remember it. You have seen it in the Wychwood. You have seen the shadow."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_5__c">"The sun is rapidly sinking, and you see the shadows getting longer. Darkness is coming.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_6__a">"You are too focused on your own survival to help anyone. You press on, wincing at the scream of deadly terror behind you. A last look, and you see them engulfed in thick smoke emanating from the beast, the Doom of Bastone running over them, stomping one of them to death under its giant foot.

You know you have to live, so their death is not in vain. You must reach Verum with what you know."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_7__a">You see your companion stumble. This bloody beast has taken enough from you and will not take any more today. You stop and charge back toward the oncoming beast. Grabbing your companion, you pick them up. You throw them over your shoulder, flying into the Deepwood and running as hard as you can despite your heavy burden.</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_8__a">"Blindly you fling yourself through the trees, heedless of all but the hot breath at your back. Suddenly you are out in the open, leaving the Deepwood behind you. You have entered a dark empty field, void of trees, with a cold haze surrounding you as you keep running. You shout out to each other and regroup before the mist can separate you. Then, the Doom of Bastone crashes out of the treeline. There is nowhere you can hide from it now. You get ready for what surely will be your final battle.

The beast stops, snorting heavily, saliva dripping from its enormous snout. Its front claws paw the ground as its eyes burn with a sick hunger. It snorts again then sniffs, seemingly less sure of itself. It roars in frustration, pounding the earth at the edge of the clearing. You do not know what to make of what happens next. It turns away from you, and its huge form blotting out the sinking sun carves a path back into the Deepwood.

Something is very wrong. 

Looking around, you take in the clearing for the first time. You are standing in a field of corpses. Human and A'Dendri soldiers are scattered everywhere, half sunken into the ground, dusted in hoarfrost… perfectly preserved. A chill runs up your spine. The A'Dendri and Humans had been fighting each other, two armies in a pitched battle. There have never been any battles in the Deepwood. This battlefield must be ancient, so how has nothing decayed? You look at each other, and begin to make for the far side of the clearing. As you do so, you notice the weapons of these ancient warriors are equally well preserved. Fine craftsmanship and keen edges glint in the icy cold."</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_9__a">As you make your way across the battlefield, looting what you can, you notice something strange. The shadows cast by the dead are lengthening before your eyes. The last few rays of sunlight are receding from the area, but these shadows are pressing in too fast, and seem to reach out like hands. Shocked by what you are seeing, you fail to notice what is coming for you from behind.</string>
    <string name="chp11_21_9__c">"Recoiling from the blow, you turn with just enough time to ward off Guide's next attack. The shock of it nearly breaks your arm. What is she doing? Face to face, you look into Guide's eyes and see nothing but black pits there, cold as the grave.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11_epi_1__a">"The shadowman coils and writhes within you, you can feel its pain, its weakness. Screaming inside your mind, you expel the darkness - black vapor gushing from your eyes and mouth. A torch swipe from your companion sees the vapor burn to nothing. 

A moment is all you have and it is all you need to escape. Rushing for the treeline, you never thought you would be happy to see the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp11_epi_2__a">"Willem takes up Guide's body, intent on bringing it back with you to Verum. You do not object. After all she has done she deserves to be given a proper burial in her true home. Without Guide and her courage, you would not have made it through the Wychwood. Now she was robbed of her chance for freedom, even in death."</string>

    <string name="chp11_epi_4__a">Enveloped once more under the canopy, you retrieve the now battered blood compass that had been given to you in Verum. You would never find your way back without it, and with the knowledge you now carry, that is not an option.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_10__c">"You slowly enter the grove, but before you can do anything to get the Grove Maiden's attention, the whole place comes alive. Within the blink of an eye, vines and other plants surround you, entangling your arms and legs more and more. You know you have not got long before you will be immobilized completely."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_10__e">While you are struggling against the reaching vines, you can see Merilla sneaking into the grove from the other side, carefully sidestepping the growing plants. Apparently, the Grove Maiden has not noticed her… yet. Merilla bends down to pick up a large seed.</string>

Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_11__a">"You hack at the vines desperately, and try to wriggle free from their iron grip before your limbs go numb. When you free yourself from one vine, another tries to entangle you. Everyone is on their own, fighting for their lives, and you barely make it out. Stumbling away from the grove, your hearts still beating in your chests like drums, you realize you are missing someone. You turn around and see her - Merilla is still in the grove, a large seed in her hand. Vines have wrapped themselves tightly around her neck, lifting her up from the ground. Before you can intervene, her assistants rush to her rescue. As soon as they reach the grove however, they fall under the raging assault of the plants onto the fruitful ground, never to rise again. Merilla's body jerks one last time. Then her hand lets go of the prize. Unmoving, she hangs there, while the Grove Maiden continues her work. With one last look at the ones you were charged to protect, you back away into the woods."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_12__a">You hack at the vines and wriggle free from their numbing grip. While you escape the plants trying to hold you, you notice Merilla struggling, a thick vine wrapping itself around her neck. One of you rushes to her side, ripping the vine from her throat and pulling her out along with you. Stumbling away from the grove, your hearts still beating in your chests like drums, you turn around and see the Grove Maiden quietly continuing her work. Merilla holds up her hand in triumph - still holding the seed she has taken from the grove.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_13__c">"You turn to leave, but one of you steps on a twig that snaps loudly. You look up barely in time to see the whole place come alive. Within the blink of an eye, vines and other plants surround you, entangling your arms and legs more and more. You know you have not got long before you will be immobilized completely. While you squirm, the A'Dendri continues her work."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_13__e">Cursing every vegetable you have ever met, you tear free of your bonds, and make for the cover of the woods. This place may be more beautiful than the Deepwood, but it is no less deadly.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_14__a">As you depart, you become aware of a dark figure moving through the forest, away from the grove, holding a small bag in its hand. Could it be the asset? Whoever it is, they disappear into the trees and as alien sounds rise from the grove behind you, you know you must disappear too.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_1__a">"You have followed the path for quite some time before you enter a grove filled with verdant life. Fresh shoots sprout everywhere from the damp soil and saplings surround a depression in the forest floor. There in the middle, a slender A'Dendri is creating something by picking up living plants and growing them together. Guide Knocks, \"Birthing place, Grove Maiden.\" Taking in the scene, you see you are in a sort of nursery where fledgling A'Dendri and bioforms are grown. If anyone knows where 'Mother' can be found, it might be her. A sound from your right draws your attention. A heap of dead wood is being sorted by a bioconstruct, its multitude of vine-like appendages ripping at the branches. No, not branches… arms. With disgust, you realize these are dead A'Dendri and they are being used to fertilize the growing ones. Guide seems not to notice."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_2__a">"\"Oh, that's fascinating!\" Merilla gasps, her eyes wide with excitement. Her assistants seem equally thrilled. \"They seem to have perfected the art of composting. And look at this expert crossbreeding! We have to do some research here and take some seeds so we can study them back home,\" she says. And in your direction she adds, \"We won't get another chance at this and they may be the key to cure the plague!\"

    <string name="chp11a_10_6__a">"With hand signaling made impossible in this situation, you shout for Guide to commune with the Grove Maiden. Immediately, she releases spores toward the Grove Maiden who looks up for the first time, acknowledging your presence. The advancing vines pause as Guide and the Grove Maiden communicate silently. Then Guide communicates, \"Retreat now,\" and the plants allow you to leave the grove.

Walking away, Guide conveys that she now knows how to find 'Mother'. But while she seems hopeful about it, you note a strong feeling of sadness radiating from her. When asked about it, she tries to translate what she just learned. The Deepwood border is getting nearer and nearer to the grove. This may be the last generation of A'Dendri the Grove Maiden is growing. Then she will become landless, expelled by her people never to return."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_7__c">You stumble away from the grove, your hearts still beating in your chests like drums. You turn around and see the Grove Maiden quietly continuing her work. That could have gone better, but at least you got out. You blindly follow the beautiful forest path, musing on how different everything here is compared to the Deepwood - but never forgetting it is no less deadly.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_8__a">Stealing things from a nursery whilst in the depths of hostile territory sounds like kicking a Deepwood cyst to you. You command the group away from the grove. There is no point gaining anything to help with the plague if it will be left on your corpse in these woods.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_10_9__c">"Charging into the grove with weapons drawn, you aim to incapacitate the Grove Maiden as quickly as possible. She looks up, surprised. Then the whole place comes alive. Within the blink of an eye, vines and other plants surround you, entangling your arms and legs more and more. Under the Grove Maiden's stare, you know you have not got long before you will be immobilized completely."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_11_1__a">"As you walk along this path, you find your visibility diminished by the thick brush and it is hard to get any sense of direction. You become aware of something above you casting a huge shadow along with a creaking sound. Startled, you immediately grab your weapons and look up. But there is nothing attacking you. Instead, you see a strange structure swaying in the trees that is clearly made, but looks old and overgrown. Whatever it is, it has a commanding view over the surrounding Wychwood and may be a good place to get your bearings. You have wandered through this forest long enough without having a clear direction. But there are no ladders, so if you want up you will have to climb the tree.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_11_3__a">"You make short work of the climb and are rewarded with a far reaching view from the structure's pinnacle. To your left, you see a tree glowing with many spores, a meeting place of sorts. In front, you see what looks like a darker patch of wood that could be a good hiding place. To your right, you see a grove of some kind, verdant with life.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_11_4__a">"Helping each other up the knotted surface, you are making good progress until you lose your handhold and slip. You fall two dozen feet or more, but thankfully the underbrush of leaves and vines provides some cushion for your landing. That was a waste of time, and the crash that accompanied your fall may have been enough to alert the A'Dendri to your whereabouts. Working out a crick in your back, you head down the only path left to you."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_12_1__a">"You press on late into the day, traveling uphill for some time through colder air and mist that obscure your view and drain the wood's colors in the fading daylight. You are rewarded for your efforts - a beautiful, serene waterfall is filling a small pond here, its water so clean and clear you can easily see the bottom. You drink your fill and set up camp, falling asleep to the peaceful gurgle of the water."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_12_1__c">You wake up, and feel this night has been the most restorative you have had in years. Old wounds easing, you pack up, your eyes rest on the river flowing down into a nearby valley. You feel strangely drawn to the shaded valley and resolve to explore it.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_14_1__a">"You descend into the valley, where very old trees stand side by side, their trunk's bark thick, almost wrinkled, some looking like faces. As you step onto the soft ground, covered with moss and foliage, you wonder how long it has been since someone walked here. The canopy is thick overhead, and a pale gloom surrounds you, lit by phosphorescent fungi and glow flies. You somehow know what you are looking for - a curtain of willow thirty feet high sways gently in the breeze. You are not sure if it will be safe to enter, but despite this thought you step inside, all of you, without discussion. Are you still in control of your actions?

The willows part to make way for you, and you enter a starlit glade. Within, great limbs of surrounding trees reach out to cover the area, making a shaded dome where thousands of pinprick shafts of light caress a solitary ancient tree. There are not many things left in this world that can take the breath from you, but the haunting beauty of the Mother's sanctum is one of them. You tread the soft grass of the glade, following paths of wild flowers that lead to the base of the tree. As you do, it strikes you that there are no guards here, as though Mother need not fear anything that could find her here."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_14_2__a">"You approach the majestic willow tree, marveling at the massive moss-covered trunk and the mighty limbs reaching high into the sky. By its sheer size alone, you can tell that it must be ancient. Then it hits you - this is the Mother, before you, under you, above you. She is the tree. A single spore slowly floats toward Guide. She reaches out to it and lets it land on her open palm. Through the Knock, she tells you, \"Mother welcomes you. Not much time. She fights the Deepwood. Her children are twisted. She has answers we seek. Show you?\" You nod. With your consent, Mother releases a thin stream of spores that flow through the air and settle softly on your exposed skin. With sharp inhalation, the spores enter your mind. Feelings and emotions not your own swirl around you as the world spins. 

Humans from an age long past, hacking at trees centuries old, making them fall in the blink of an eye. Treekillers. You feel a great sadness, emptiness and lost potential. Humans with sharp metal weapons on a vast battlefield. Treekillers. You see great bioforms and A'Dendri rise up to resist the Treekillers. They meet in battle, and life water feeds the soil. It is not enough though. As both armies are turned to mulch, shadows begin to rise from the ground - dark, hateful things, and beyond them a larger shadow looms over all. You see the Great Father rise to defend the land, but he too is consumed by the shadow. Hope turns to desperation and the shadow advances. As it gets closer, you see the dark shape come into focus - as the blighted trunks of the Deepwood trees.

At last, a final intense picture comes to you. A cave. A cave that swallows up all light. It is the Heart of Darkness and as you stare into its depth, you feel yourself drawn into its inky blackness, deeper and deeper. 

Then the light leaves you, and with it your consciousness."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_2_0__a">"The morning sun is breaking through the trees, illuminating your environment more and more. With the arrival of the light, the wood is awakening. You have the impression of movement, of the trees and other plants shifting around, although you could not explain what you are observing. The air is filled with tiny A'Dendri spores. It seems there is more to their presence, they serve a purpose in these woods.

You shoulder your packs again and begin to venture deeper into the Wychwood, hoping to find a clue to this \"Mother\" creature's whereabouts, and somehow, you need to hide from the A'Dendri in their own territory…

You become aware of two paths that you could swear were not there before. When looking down one path, you get a light feeling with tinges of exoticness. When looking down the other path, you get a feeling of being thankful for the history given.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_3_1__a">"The path leads you toward the shadowy side of a steep boulder hill. You reach a clearing with a magnificent sight that makes you stop in your tracks - a thousand glowing lights are dancing in the air. Only when one of them comes very close do you realize that they are tiny bugs. Suddenly, from the fringes of the clearing, a bioconstruct moves into view sporting huge flowers the size of carts on its back. It moves beneath the swarm and shakes its huge bulk. In an instant every point of light in the clearing rushes to land on the flowers, creating great orbs of illumination. Ringed in light that projects dozens of paces in all directions the bioconstruct lumbers away into the trees leaving you to decide where to go next.

There are two paths in front of you. When looking down one path, you get a feeling of moving fast. When looking down the other path, you get a feeling of being thankful for the history given.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_4_1__a">"After walking this way for a while, you can feel the sunshine warming you. The woods are getting sparser here, only small trees standing apart from one another. Then you see it - the largest tree you have ever set eyes on. When you tilt your head back, you can barely see the top of it, its dark green leaves glittering in the sun high above the adjacent treetops. Its trunk is very straight with a dark brown color and its branches are overgrown with thick green vines. After looking at the tree long enough, you could swear it is moving ever so slightly.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_4_2__a">"Could this be the Mother? You intend to find out and walk up to the tree, shouting a greeting. There is no reaction. You quickly realize your mistake and use the Knock, signaling Guide to translate, only to find her shaking and making strange noises. Concerned, you try to make out her message. But what you finally come up with is, \"Funny.\" Guide is laughing! Relieved, you smile at her and she signals that while every tree in the Wychwood is a living being, not all are A'Dendri. She adds, \"Some in between you will meet.\""</string>
    <string name="chp11a_4_3__a">"You continue on your way until the path divides into two. When looking down one path, you get a feeling of being connected to all beings. When looking down the other path, you get a feeling of infinite future possibilities.

    <string name="chp11a_5_1__a">"Walking on, you observe more and more vines growing on the trees, hanging from them like huge spiderwebs, spanning from one tree to another. But there is something alive about them, that distinguishes them from other vines that you have seen – even here. As you draw nearer to take a good look at them at close range, you see that they are pulsating and glowing from within, as if something is rushing through them. Guide explains, \"A'Dendri spores inside. Reach far.\"

You are curious to examine them closer as this may tell you something of 'Mother', but what if the A'Dendri can find you through the vine?


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_5_2__a">"You continue on your way and can soon see the paths diverge again. The glowing vines are still around you and seem to grow forth in both directions. When looking down one path you get a feeling of infinite future possibilities. When looking down the other path you get a feeling of being connected to all things.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_5_3__a">"The moment your skin touches the plant, you get the sensation of the vine shying away from you. Fear and hate strike you while your awareness is swept with the sensation:

\"Treekiller, Treekiller, TREEKILLER!\"

As your conscious thoughts are crushed, disturbing images flash before your mind's eye…

Humans from an age long past, hacking at trees centuries old, making them fall in the blink of an eye. Humans setting fire to a wood filled with life, dooming all who flee the flames to landlessness. Humans with sharp metal weapons battling A'Dendri who send their ancients to sacrifice themselves. A dark harrowing shadow looming behind the humans on the battlefield - the warmonger, the soul-eater, the light-quencher. Then, everything goes dark."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_5_3__c">You need a few moments to recover from that emotional onslaught. Only then do you realize that you have let go of the vine without noticing. You find Guide watching you, her eyes revealing nothing.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_7_1__a">"Following the path, you see a lot of colors shine in the sunlight ahead through the trees, which become fewer and fewer the more you approach. You come to something that could only be described as a field - a thing from human history. What is even stranger is what seems to be cultivated here by the A'Dendri are mushrooms. They are everywhere, in every color and every size. Some look familiar and possibly edible. Finding fresh food when away from a human settlement is always beneficial, if only you could trust your eye with these mushrooms."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_7_2__a">Against your better judgement, you decide to head out and search for any mushrooms that might be edible. You walk around in the field. Some mushrooms have a dangerous feel to them, with strange net-like things protruding from their heads or with colors so bright they are most certainly poisonous and deadly.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_7_3__a">"As you are looking to set out again, you can see two paths available to you. When looking down one path you get a feeling of being connected to all beings. When looking down the other path you get a feeling of guidance.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_8_1__c">"There is movement ahead. You freeze and hold up your hand to stop the others from giving away your position. As you crouch down and peer through the undergrowth, you observe a large group of A'Dendri surrounding a huge tree. These are no Rangers, you can tell. One catches your eye - she has a lot of flowers on her head, losing petals and pollen with every step. A very small A'Dendri is running after her, collecting the petals as if playing. It quickly jumps to the side as an Ancient approaches. The tree itself is glowing from a thousand spores that surround it, streaming out of big porose fruits that grow on its branches. You now realize that glowing vines feed into the tree from all directions. Guide attempts to convey something, but all you understand is that this is an important place for, \"Sharing knowledge.\""</string>
    <string name="chp11a_8_2__a">A whirring sound tears you from your thoughts. Almost directly above you, high up in the trees, some bizarre spidery bioconstructs hang in the air, held up by giant insect-like wings. They all seem to be holding onto something large that looks like… a net! They descend rapidly toward you.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_8_2__c">"You hack at the nets and slip away into the dense undergrowth, the winged creatures unable to follow. That was close! Guide looks at you, radiating a feeling of urgency. She signals in the Knock, \"Mushroom! Hide you!\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_8_3__a">"You decide it is definitely time to leave this place. As you turn away from the glowing tree, you see two new paths available to you.

When looking down one path you get a feeling of nurturing life. When looking down the other path you get a feeling of imminent death.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_8_4__a">"Hidden in the relative safety of the thick vegetation, you take out the mushrooms, giving everyone a piece. This better be worth it, you think as you swallow.

At first, nothing happens other than you feeling a numbness on your tongues and a growling in your bellies. Then the world becomes very intense. You cannot remember lying down, but the sky is now before you. Or did it move there somehow? You try to explain to yourself why that should not be possible – and fail. It is hard to concentrate, because the whole wood is screaming at you, \"TREEKILLER! TREEKILLER! TREEKILLER!\", in a deafening roar. Then something else distracts you. An animal is walking over you with its long bony legs, sniffing you, searching for something. But this is wrong because it does not have a face and its body is made out of branches. Finally, the wood's anger seems to subside, its strange voices slowly fading to silence. The trees are crying now, their tears blind you and wash away the confusion.

Slowly, the world goes back to normal. There was more going on earlier, but you have forgotten most of it. Was that a dream? You shake each other back to reality and get back on your feet."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_1__c">"After following the path for some time, it becomes narrow and nearly impassable as you come upon more and more dead trees lying on the ground, blocking your way. Strangely enough, they do not seem to have fallen here, but were rather transported to this place. 

You are discussing turning back, when you see an A'Dendri lying on her back, motionless. Carefully drawing closer, you see that she is a Ranger but without her bow and arrows. You notice that her bark-like skin shows some deep notches on her left side. On your approach, she opens her eyes and quickly gets to her feet. Her eyes dart toward Guide and the two exchange some spores.

With Guide's help she conveys that she was wounded and has since lost the ability to grow arrows. She is now waiting to be reclaimed."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_2__a">"She also sends some spores your way, acknowledging your presence as a free A'Dendri in this company. You share an understanding of what it means to be disconnected, not only from A'Dendri society but from the land. Because you too are landless, and that loss is a pain that can never be healed. But overlapping that outlook, you feel her desperation over losing her integral ability, something you know is nothing less than a loss of identity. Without it, only death awaits. You know there is another way. She could start anew, somewhere but here. But for that, she would need purpose. She needs a weapon."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_4__a">"You realize that without being able to regrow arrows, she has lost an ability paramount to her function as a Ranger. But with a new weapon she would still be a skilled fighter. A'Dendri society may not consider her valuable anymore, but you might.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_5__a">You pick a weapon and hand it to her. After Guide has conveyed your proposal to the wounded Ranger, no translation is necessary for you. Emitting a strong feeling of thankfulness toward you, her whole body shows her new sense of purpose, blossoming alongside some flowers opening and blooming brightly on her head. She does not need to collect anything. Everything she owns, she already carries with her.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_5__c">With a new ally in tow, you move on.</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_6__a">"You can neither help her, nor can you change A'Dendri society. So you leave her to her terrible fate. The wounded Ranger seems to lose some color and a few flowers on her head wilt away. Then she lays back down on the ground, apparently not knowing what else to do, waiting for death as you make your way forward on the path that ironically, now gives you the feeling of nurturing life."</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_7__a">"After this explanation, the Wychwood feels even stranger to you. You fight to defy death, your wounds give you focus and purpose to keep going. To admit defeat so readily seems alien to you. You may not understand the situation, but might still be able to help.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11a_9_8__a">"The Broken Ranger refuses your kind offer to try and heal her wounds. With Guide's help, you encourage her to keep fighting against the common enemy - the Deepwood. But her soul seems as broken as her body and your efforts to save her are in vain."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_10__a">Leaning in close, you stare Cyprian in the eye. If this does not work, there will be blood.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_11__a">"Suddenly, you hear a booming voice that sounds familiar, \"Get your hands off me! Where are you taking me?\" Cyprian is being led toward you by a group of A'Dendri Rangers. His face brightens as he becomes aware of your presence, \"Ah! The expedition! And my squire! You finally made it too,\" he smirks. Willem looks away, a cross between hatred and fear on his face.

Guide conveys what she is picking up from spore communication, \"Rangers find Knight. Deepwood. Say belong with us. Our responsibility.\""</string>

Guide conveys what she is picking up from spore communication, \"Rangers find Knight. Deepwood. Say belong with us. Our responsibility.\"

You sigh inwardly, knowing there will be trouble and wonder what happened to Cyprian's own responsibility, his squire. You assume Willem's absence can only mean one thing."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_13__a">"Looking around, you decide what to do next.


Choose one:
If you have 4 or more Tokens on the Time Track, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a location to explore that you have not been to before."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_1__a">"While you and your Ranger Guards make your way through the Wychwood, the morning sun is breaking through the trees, illuminating your environment more and more. With the arrival of the light, the wood is awakening. You have the impression of movement, of the trees and other plants shifting around, although you could not explain what you are observing. The air is filled with tiny A'Dendri spores. It seems their presence in this wood serves a purpose of some significance.

After a long walk without rest, you see some massive trees up ahead, their broad trunks rising straight up with bark the color of white marble. Coming closer, you see their thick branches are closely interwoven. On the paths thus created, crowned by elaborate formations of living wood, you see A'Dendri strolling from tree to tree at dizzying heights. The palatial trees are overgrown with beautiful flowers in abundance, their delicate white petals shimmering like gold in the blazing sun.

On the ground, there are some very large bioconstructs at work. One type, with two muscular arms and very large hands, is going about uprooting young trees. Another one reaches into the earth, loosening it up with its rapidly digging tentacle-like arms.

The sound from Guide's Knock tears you from the captivating sights, \"Matriarch meet there,\" pointing to the white tree. \"Not now. Later. Permission given. Walk free.\" Something in her face tells you she doubts the notion of freedom very much. You clearly sense her fear."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_2__a">"After the Rangers gauge you have understood the rules, they depart, leaving you alone for the first time since entering the Wychwood. Taking in your surroundings, you discuss which areas you want to explore. Your time is limited and you can only visit each location once. Around the palace itself are large grown structures with A'Dendri moving between them, many are armed or burdened with strange objects. Away from the ornate majesty of the Palace in the surrounding wood is another vast structure, which appears ancient and abandoned. It seems to hold promise, though you are not exactly sure why. Lastly, off to your side, runs a beautiful stream that may lead to something."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_3__a">"You go to move but the Rangers stop you. \"They say, leave weapons here,\" Guide explains in the Knock.

You were not expecting this. In all human settlements, 'The Pact' ensured Oathsworn the right to bear arms at all times. This is not a human settlement though, and you are badly outnumbered. You look at the rangers and the large bioconstructs nearby and decide that giving up your weapons is the only sensible option. After all, you are here to ask the A'Dendri for their help. So you all prepare to part with your weapons. All except Cyprian.

\"I am a knight!\" he declares. \"To bear my father's sword is my birthright! And I will not have those mouthless tree-huggers take it away from me.\" You glance at the A'Dendri and for once are grateful that they do not understand your language. Nevertheless, they get his meaning and are closing in to get what they asked for. Cyprian's hand grasps the hilt of his sword, anger flaring in his face. If he is about to do something stupid, your whole mission could fail.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_4__a">Cyprian looks around, taking in his surroundings seemingly for the first time. Begrudgingly, he unbuckles his sword belt. You all hand over your weapons.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_5__a">"Your words cannot reach Cyprian, they even seem to fuel his anger. \"Don't tell me what to do, Oathsworn! If you are not on my side, then get out of my way!\" With a furious roar, he rips his sword out of its sheath, ready to strike. This fool could be the end of any negotiation between you and the A'Dendri.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_6__a">"For a brief moment, you see something in Cyprian's face you were not expecting - fear. Then he snorts and unbuckles his sword belt. \"You should see your faces! I wasn't going to fight them,\" he laughs, as you all hand over your weapons."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_7__a">You had suspected it would come to this. Regrettable, but necessary. You ready your weapons too and face your former ally. You cannot allow him to endanger your mission any longer and engage in the only language he seems to understand - violence.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_7__c">"As Cyprian falls, you stand back to catch your breath and clean his blood from your weapons. The A'Dendri have observed the fight with obvious interest. Now, two of the large bioconstructs advance - the Soil-digger preparing a hole in the ground, the Uprooter lifting Cyprian up and dispatching him into it. Within moments, the knight is gone. As you think it could not get any stranger, a small wooden creature flies over the impromptu grave, sprinkling seeds before the Soil-digger heaps another layer of soil onto the spot. Then they all hurry away to their next assignment. You get the impression Cyprian was used more as fertilizer for a flower bed than buried.

Meanwhile, Guide has new information for you, the A'Dendri have decided to let you keep your weapons. You are now allowed to walk around freely - as freely as one is able with watchful eyes everywhere."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_8__a">"You put your weapons down as a clear sign to both Cyprian and the A'Dendri - you have not come here to fight. Cyprian clearly has other ideas. As an A'Dendri steps into striking distance, Cyprian swings his sword at the Ranger, but before the knight can land his blow, he is pierced by arrows and dies instantly. You take a step back as two of the large bioconstructs advance - the Soil-digger preparing a hole in the ground, the Uprooter lifting Cyprian up and dispatching him into it. Within moments, the knight is gone. As you think it could not get any stranger, a small wooden creature flies over the impromptu grave, sprinkling seeds before the Soil-digger heaps another layer of soil onto the spot. Then they all hurry away to their next assignment. You get the impression Cyprian was used more as fertilizer for a flower bed than buried."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_8__c">After that, it takes some time to assure your guards that Cyprian was not acting on your behalf - something they seem to find very hard to believe. Finally, you manage to smooth things over with them and are allowed to walk around freely - as freely as one is able with watchful eyes everywhere.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_15_9__a">You modulate your tone, and try to express the reality of the situation to him.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_10__a">"The A'Dendri watch in silence as you weave and duck, roll and slide. The giant bioconstruct swings in great arcs, but it cannot touch you. You are no sixty-seconder, this is your profession, your life - hammered to steel in the heat of battle. At a silent command the hulk desists. The soldiers seem annoyed, they had obviously been expecting a different outcome. But you cannot shake the feeling you gave away your combat techniques to a potential enemy."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_11__a">"Your opponent is gigantic, the hulk of fibrous ropy vegetation and claws moves slowly, but the reach and relentless onslaught is hard to evade. You duck and roll under several arcing swings, but as you come up out of one attack, a backhand sees you flying across the space. You land hard. The A'Dendri are silent, but their mirth is obvious. This had been just what they were expecting. You feel like a sixty-seconder again. At least you will leave with your life, a rare consolation in your profession."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_12__a">You decide it is better to move on and not draw any unwanted attention.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_1__a">"You linger by the palatial trees and observe the different kinds of A'Dendri. Some are magnificent and shining, others are wilted and small. They come in an array of different ages, colors and sizes, with some truly colossal and powerful specimens. All are strange and fascinating in their own way.

A group comes walking up with a particularly fancy looking A'Dendri female leading the way. Her long hair-like vines float after her like a cloak, adorned with colorful flowers which constantly release a flood of spores behind her. Several pale, narrow A'Dendri hurry to follow her in perfect lockstep, eyes fixed upon their mistress. The other A'Dendri make way for her and bow, in varying degrees of submissive postures. She glances in your direction once, but you can make out no reaction to your presence. After she has walked past, Guide's Knock comes like a whisper, \"Female A'Dendri nobility. Very powerful.\"

Weighing your options, you look around. Down by the giant roots of the trees there seem to be martial groups gathered around some bioconstructs. Looking up, you see a cluster of A'Dendri high in a complex structure carrying plants and vessels of soil.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_2__c">"You advance toward the palatial tree's giant roots that seem to dive into the earth like fat snakes. Up ahead, you notice some grown structures that have a military feel to them, with spikes lurking out under the shades of green. Before them, a group of A'Dendri train in full-contact combat against hulking bioconstructs of wooden teeth and claws. Guide explains that these are not only used for training but also utilized in the 'War of the Roots' against the Deepwood. Watching the A'Dendri train is of professional interest to you, but not important right now."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_30__c">Standing beneath the giant trees, you look up at their perfectly smooth trunks, their lowest branches as high as the tallest building of Verum. There are no stairs or ladders and you have no idea how to get up there. But Guide knows. She walks toward one of the plants that grows at the base of the trees and releases her spores into their funnel-shaped flower heads. She then Knocks, \"Stand still,\" to you as long vines descend from the palatial trees, wrapping themselves around your knees and upper body to lift you gently but quickly into the air. You fight the urge to hack at the vines and try to free yourselves. A fall from this height could be deadly.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_31__a">"The vines set you down on a broad limb of the tree which houses the oddly wrought structure. To either side an unguarded drop promises a swift end, a fact none of the A'Dendri going to and fro seem to notice. Curiosity drives you forward and you explore the strange paths the A'Dendri take laden with compost, mulch and moss.

Finally, you reach a platform of densely interwoven branches and vines, on which a variety of small plants grow in wooden bowls. Many bowls, however, only contain soil of different colors. A female A'Dendri seems to work here and looks up as you approach, watching you closely while exchanging spores with Guide, who then explains. She struggles to find the right sign for what she wishes to express about the A'Dendri's role here, and in the end settles on 'Herbalist' and 'Archivist'. The 'Herbalist' leads you to a very large bowl filled with sick looking soil. You would know that ichorous mulch anywhere - it is Deepwood soil. Guide recoils. She knocks, \"Dangerous to bring here.\" You are surprised to see the crude bowl is made from crushed human armor plates held together by rust."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_32__a">"Merilla understands immediately. She smiles at the 'Herbalist' with obvious respect for her work. \"That's why she has it in a metal bowl. For safe study, to keep it from contacting other vegetation!\" What the old botanist considers safe, Guide seems to regard as pure folly. Spores continue to flow between the two A'Dendri.

\"She need more iron, for more understanding,\" Guide explains to you with swift hand motions as the A'Dendri looks over your many weapons and armor pieces. \"She want trade,\" Guide Knocks. Whatever they are attempting here, they seem to want your metal for it, and are offering some sort of plant in return."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_32__c">"After your trading, the A'Dendri appears to be pleased with Merilla's interest and takes another, smaller metal bowl and fills it with a portion of the Deepwood soil, taking care not to touch it directly. She gestures to the other bowls of soil and the plants around her, and Guide translates her spore communication into, \"Searching Cure.\" Merilla and her assistants are very keen on staying for the experiment, to learn, and share their knowledge. However, it has not taken so long that you could not make for some of the other locations if you wish.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_33__a">"With Guide's translation, the 'Herbalist' explains the different kinds of soils and plants to the botanists in great detail. She also asks you many questions about the Deepwood. You even manage to answer a few of them, explaining the role salt plays in keeping the Deepwood at bay at city walls. After a tedious process of mixing different compounds together, they sprinkle a portion of an auburn soil mix into the small bowl with the dark Deepwood soil. On top of this, they place a small plant. You all surround the bowl to witness the experiment.

The 'Herbalist' sends out some spores to the plant, an air of excitement palpable around her. The plant begins to grow before your eyes in reaction to her spores. As the plant thrives to everyone's surprise and delight, the dark soil seems to take on a browner, more natural color. But then the plant suddenly pales, the auburn soil turns dark, and red thorns dripping with a yellow liquid start to grow out of the previously natural looking plant. You pull a chunk of amber out of your pocket. The spark is quickly struck, and soon the hostile plant is on fire. Frightened, the A'Dendri steps back from the flames. Soon only ash remains and everyone regains their composure despite the disappointment.

Before you leave, the 'Herbalist' presents you with a small bag of bast fibers with some plant seeds in it. Merilla is delighted, and she thanks the A'Dendri telling her this could be the most valuable gift they have ever received."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_34__a">"\"She need more Iron for understanding,\" Guide explains to you with swift hand motions as the A'Dendri looks over your many weapons and armor pieces. \"She want trade,\" Guide Knocks. Whatever they are attempting here, they seem to want your metal for it, and are offering some sort of plant in return."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_34__c">"The 'Herbalist' returns to her work mixing compounds with soil. It seems this entire structure is given over to this undertaking. You wonder what its purpose is, but after your negotiations the 'Herbalist' seems disinterested in communicating with you further."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_3__a">"You realize that Cyprian is no longer with your group. Looking around you spot him as he is just entering a cave, formed naturally under the roots of the palatial trees. What is he doing? He could endanger the mission. You could go after him, but that may draw attention. If he gets caught, it could be over for everyone.

    <string name="chp11b_16_40__a">"Judging there is no more to be gained here, you leave. With Guide's help, you descend the palatial trees in the same manner you arrived."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_41__a">"Down by the palatial tree's base, you recognize the A'Dendri noble you saw earlier standing in your path, surrounded by her pale attendants, her flowery vines dancing in the breeze. Guide stops in her tracks, telling you, \"No. Female nobility. Too dangerous…\" The noble turns toward Guide and releases a single spore. It drifts quickly to rest on Guide and she goes rigid. After a moment, she relaxes. Guide continues, \"She help us. Has important knowledge. About Matriarch.\" In the meantime, the A'Dendri noble has drawn nearer, followed by her entourage. As she sends out her spores again, her presence feels like a blessing, an emotion so intense it is almost overwhelming."</string>

Choose the option that corresponds to your result:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_44__c">"Your mind is no longer yours. You will do anything this A'Dendri commands. Her presence now lurks behind your consciousness, forcing you to follow the rest of your group without telling them what you will do when the moment comes: YOU WILL ATTACK THE A'DENDRI MATRIARCH."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_45__c">The world is suddenly ablaze. Burning trees fall down beside you and scorch your feet. Rage burns hot inside of you, like the flames and smoke that sting your eyes. You let it all out, like a scream, having your people attack those that dare to destroy what is not theirs to take. Their red blood gushes out, and gathers in pools that sink into the ground, where one day trees will grow again. And it will begin anew.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_46__c">"A white light blinds you. In it you see a female A'Dendri so powerful you can feel it. The vines growing from her head are longer than her body and covered with pitch black flowers. They move about her like snakes while she stares at you. Her gaze is terrifying, but you cannot look away. Your knees become weak and dread washes over you."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_47__a">You need a moment to recover and check if everyone seems alright. What happened? There was a… female… no a… someone, the memory fades as a few spores are blown into the breeze. You look at Guide in hope of an explanation, but she seems distant and has nothing to say to you.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_4__a">"You head over to the cave, keeping your head down. Inside, you find several of the clawed bioconstructs seemingly asleep. Cyprian stands before one of them, his back turned to you. \"Looking for something?\" you ask, accusation in your voice.

Startled, he turns. In his hand he holds something - a weapon? Then you realize what it is. The construct behind him is missing one of its long claws. Cyprian grins, \"I want to be prepared, in case these wildlings decide not to help us.\" As he is about to leave, you block his way. His taking something from the A'Dendri could go very wrong. A lot of people's lives, probably your own included, depend on completing your task. The knight glares at you angrily and waves his newly found weapon, \"Who's side are you on?\" In this moment, you are painfully aware that you are unarmed.

    <string name="chp11b_16_5__a">You had suspected it would come to this. Regrettable, but necessary.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_5__c">"Cyprian's final battle is quite unknightly, without formality or fairness, fighting with a crude A'Dendri weapon against unarmed allies. His death is not pretty. As you stand there catching your breath, you become aware of a large bioconstruct advancing from outside the cave - one you have seen earlier. You stand back, as the Uprooter lifts up Cyprian's body and carries it outside where the Soil-digger has prepared a hole in the ground into which Cyprian is dispatched and covered with earth. Within moments, the knight is gone. As you think it could not get any stranger, a small wooden creature flies over the impromptu grave, sprinkling seeds before the Soil-digger heaps another layer of soil onto the spot. Then they all hurry away to their next assignment. You get the impression that Cyprian was used more as fertilizer for a flower bed than buried. Also, you are quite aware now, that nothing you do in the Wychwood will be without the A'Dendri's knowledge."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_6__a">An open conflict could harm your mission more than do it good. Leaving Cyprian be, you turn and start to head off. Soon he joins your group again, as if nothing happened.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_16_7__a">"As you go to leave, one of the training A'Dendri breaks away from the melee and runs toward you. Guide receives his spores and translates his request. You try your best to keep up with her rapid hand movements. He seems to be offering a challenge for one of you to take on the bioconstruct to avoid its attacks. The A'Dendri leads you toward one of the caves under the palatial trees to show you 'human treasures' according to Guide's Knock. It turns out to be an impressively large pile, consisting mostly of rusty armor plates and weapons, time having taken its toll on them. Without asking where they got these, you look through the discarded items and find a leather pouch that holds some Iron.

    <string name="chp11b_16_8__c">Stepping into the combat zone, the hulking form of your opponent rears over you. When its first blow lands, you start to wonder if this was such a good idea.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_17_13__a">You leave this ancient part of the Wychwood, and retrace your steps toward the palatial trees.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_17_1__a">"You leave the palatial trees to explore the surrounding area where you come across an ancient grown structure. As you enter, you almost get the impression of wandering through a great, shadowy hall, with giant round pillars supporting its green roof. \"Very old trees here,\" Guide Knocks. In size and splendor this may have once rivaled the holy cathedrals of Cistercia, but it now seems abandoned. Guide looks at it with a feeling of both pride and sadness. Her Knock translates to, \"Long ago, free A'Dendri build. We were many. Had no fear. We had Mother. Not have Matriarch.\"

A boulder catches your attention that is of a different color to the others you have seen in these woods. You draw nearer to have a look at it, and see its shape is far too smooth to occur naturally. But until now, you have not seen anything made from stone by the A'Dendri. Especially, no stones with pictures on them. You wipe away the dirt and the leaves to reveal the whole boulder is covered with them, mural paintings that must be centuries old. You think of Edith, and what she might have been able to discern from them."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_17_2__a">"Even with Guide's help, translating the great murals takes time."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_17_2__c">Eventually you think you have pieced together the memory it stores.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_17_3__a">"You study the murals, pointing out different figures and symbols to each other, trying to understand their meaning. Figures with tree-like heads and bows seem to represent A'Dendri. But there are also humans depicted. The pictures are telling very different stories. On one, the humans are shown beside a burning tree. As you point toward it, Guide tells you, \"Treekillers.\" On another, humans fight against A'Dendri, which Guides explains as, \"A'Dendri fight for land.\" One picture is the most disturbing. It shows a pool of darkness with grasping hands reaching up to consume both human and A'Dendri. Guide continues, but it is confusing, \"Shadows,\" followed by a series of jagged taps of a finger over her palm. Moving shadows? Sliding? No… Creeping shadows."</string>

    <string name="chp11b_18_11__a">You ask Guide to try and calm the hound and she releases some spores toward it so you can come close and examine the broken leg further. The leg closely resembles one of an animal in shape, but without flesh and blood - just interwoven branches and plants somehow function together in this strange organism. You realize you have no idea how to help a plant-based life form heal.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_12__a">You head back to the stream, and follow it to the palatial trees.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_13__a">"You follow its trail for a short while, but at some point you lose it. Habit would make you look for excretions, hair and so on, but of course these clues are missing. A creature made of plant matter is almost invisible in a forest.

So you return and follow the stream back to the palatial trees."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_1__a">"Through a natural opening in the rocks, clear water flows into a pond here, thus feeding the river that leads to the palatial trees. You look into the pond, its water so clean you can easily see the bottom. This seems like the perfect spot to fill up your waterskins. As you take them from your belts, Guide requests your attention, \"Spring water must stay pure to not disturb cycle. Water cycle is essential for all life.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_2__a">"You agree that water is essential for life - also for yours. You will not let some A'Dendri superstition get in the way of drinking your fill when you have a clean water source in front of you. So you take your waterskins and kneel down to fill them. At the same moment, an arrow hits the ground directly before you. You stop and look for the archer but do not see anyone behind the trees. However, this was clearly a warning from the A'Dendri Rangers. One you had better take seriously. Leaving the spring behind, you keep going."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_3__a">"You decide it is a good idea to respect their cultural sensitivities and put away your waterskins. Guide kneels down by a group of unremarkable vines that grow from the shore into the water. She touches one of them briefly, whereupon the plant lifts a remarkably large and thick leaf from the bottom of the spring and pushes it far beyond the edge of the bank, above Guide's head. There the leaf clamshells and a fine trickle of water rains down on Guide. She washes her hands and face in a ritual manner. Then invites you to do the same.

Gladly you wash the dirt and sweat from your journey off your face and hands. With Guide's permission, you also use the plants to take a few sips."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_4__a">"While walking upstream along the river you suddenly see a strange creature standing on the other side. It is no animal, but apparently made of plant material, and quite small, maybe only reaching to your knee, with four legs and a tail. You are strongly reminded of the forgotten King's creature that you slew, but this one seems far more peaceful. \"Hound,\" Guide tells you, \"Find and bring things.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_5__a">"It is hard to follow the hound's trail, since clues like excretions and hair you would normally look for are missing. A creature made of plant matter is almost invisible in a forest, but you are experts at tracking in difficult terrain. When you catch up with it again, it is lying in a sunny spot on a warm rock.

You approach with caution. The hound raises its head and looks at you, its nose twitching as it picks up your strange scent. It moves to get to its feet, but one of its front legs buckles and it sits down on its hind legs again, holding one of its strange wooden paws slightly above the ground. You can see now that the wood on this leg is splintered and broken."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_6__a">Your Grove Maiden sends out a few spores to calm the hound and then kneels beside it. She takes its leg in her hands and lets its wood grow back together as it was. The hound holds still. When its leg is healed, it jumps up, its tail wagging back and forth as it runs circles around the group. As you go on, it follows the Grove Maiden and stays close to her.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_7__a">"But you figure, why not try and help it in the way you would help each other. You take some straight branches and rip pieces of cloth to splint the leg. The hound seems a bit frightened and concerned, jerking its leg back a few times, but finally lets you finish the procedure. You hope that somehow the leg can eventually heal now.

The hound slowly gets to its feet and takes a few tentative steps to test the leg. Slowly, it begins to wag its tail. As you leave again, it follows you.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_8__a">You just do not know how to help this creature, so you leave the hound to its own devices, hoping that it will find help elsewhere.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_18_9__a">You cannot really explain why, but somehow you feel a connection to this strange being. Following an impulse, you reach out and caress its head. A feeling of belonging emanates from the hound, who is wagging its tail so vigorously that you almost expect it to lift off the ground.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_10__a">The guards are clearly trained for this situation, and would not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for their Matriarch, or take yours to protect her. As one of them is about to strike the lethal blow, he suddenly halts - his weapon raised mid-air. Not only him. Everyone stands perfectly still - even you. Spores dance in a gentle swirl of air all around the throne room.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_11__a">"\"Enough!\" the 'puppet' spits out, disdain in his voice. \"That is not why you came. I can feel her spores on you even now.\" The Matriarch glances around the room as if looking for someone. \"She will pay for her hubris when I find her.\" Eyes returning to you. \"Now, I demand you answer to me!\""</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_12__a">"Then you see one of your group is still standing on the edge of the platform, eyes wide with hatred and fear - Cyprian.

The puppet's voice is all too calm as the Matriarch speaks through him, \"You would steal from us Treekiller?\" Clearly against his will, Cyprian drops the stolen claw from its concealment beneath his tunic. \"We had no need for weapons until the Treekillers came. You taught us to fight, and we taught you new ways to die. The Matriarch raises an arm, you know what comes next.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_13__a">With no other recourse, you entreat the Matriarch. Your words are met with silence as Cyprian stands dangerously close to the edge of the platform. Then he falls forwards, to his knees. \"You are a new type of Treekiller, interesting,\" says the puppet.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_14__a">With no other recourse, you entreat the Matriarch. Your words fall on dead ears as Cyprian stands dangerously close to the edge of the platform. A slight gesture, as if waving a fly away, makes him fall back over the lip. Not even a scream breaks the silence. Only the sound his body makes when it hits the ground far below. You count yourself lucky she spared you. \"There are worse things I could have done to him,\" the puppet croaks mindlessly, and you know she is right.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_15__a">"Maybe he was right in the end. You have to take a side. And your choice fell with the A'Dendri. The Matriarch raises her hand and with a slight gesture, as if waving a fly away, makes him fall back over the edge. Not even a scream breaks the silence. Only the sound his body makes when it hits the ground far below. You count yourself lucky she spared you."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_17__a">He has brought this on himself. But you will not stand idly by while a Knight of Verum, sent with you by the King himself, faces a death sentence for a petty misdemeanor.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_19__a">"\"I have not had the opportunity to take the lives of so many Treekillers for quite some time,\" the puppet croaks. Slowly, the Matriarch raises her hand and with a slight gesture, as if waving a fly away, makes you fall backward over the edge. You hear the shocked screams of your travel companions as you expect to fall to your death. But the vines are there to support and catch you. They wrap themselves around your body and push you back onto the platform. The Matriarch sits back down on her throne and her puppet speaks again, \"I'll let you live, but you will do something for me in return.\""</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_1__c">"Rangers approach and escort you toward the largest of the palatial trees. \"Matriarch will see us now,\" Guide tells you. Vines come down the tree to grab and pull you upward. You are set down high in the tree's crown on a grown platform, bathed in sunlight reflected by a thousand white flowers. The Rangers take up positions, flanking an elaborate throne grown from the same white marble wood as the tree itself. To your surprise, you see a human crouching on the floor. The man is in dirty rags, his long beard gray, his body weak and skinny, his eyes bereft of hope or sanity. \"Puppet,\" comes a hushed Knock from Guide, trembling with fear beside you.

A rustling of leaves makes you look up as branches bend to make room. A ray of sunlight breaks through and blinds your eyes. Surrounded by dazzling brightness, the Matriarch comes down from above. Supported by vines, she is gently lowered onto her throne. The long vines growing from her head are covered with pitch black flowers, absorbing the light. They embrace her like a living dress, and stretch out over her head and to her feet, in all directions like a crown connecting with the tree. On her throne, the living branches unfurl their leaves and the white flowers all around move to reflect the light toward her. There is no doubt who the Matriarch is here. When she is ready, she sets her gaze upon you. One of her vines moves to touch the man on the floor, releasing some spores directly onto his head.

\"Treekillers!\" he croaks. \"Explain why you desecrate our land with your presence!\" Now you understand why Guide called him 'puppet'. His own mind is gone - the Matriarch speaks through him."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_2__a">"You charge at the A'Dendri Matriarch with the intent to kill. Her guards step forward as one - rushing to shield their leader from your attack. The Matriarch herself does not even flinch. You would not have thought her gaze could get more piercing."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_3__a">"Slowly the Matriarch rises from her throne and the whole room seems to hold its breath. Somehow you know she rarely ever does that. Involuntarily, you take a step back. As her spores whirl through the room you slowly realize that you cannot control your bodies any longer. She is making you take step after step backward toward where you know the platform ends. Beyond it is nothing but empty air and a very long way down.

The 'puppet' speaks again, \"Before you open those ever-hungry mouths, remember that you are at my mercy here, Treekillers. My people have already suffered enough of your lies!\"

With only your mouth still your own, you begin to tell her of the plague. You get the impression she is looking for something in your words. You know that what you say next may decide your fate.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_4__a">"Your words have no effect. As you take another step, you look over your shoulder and shudder. One more step, and you will fall to your death.

    <string name="chp11b_19_6__a">You suddenly regain control, and stumble forwards, back from the edge. A quick look backward makes you realize you were just steps away from falling to your death.</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_7__a">"The Matriarch returns to her throne, petals unfurling as she approaches. \"I know of your plague. The smell of it reaches us even here. You are wise to seek our wisdom and foolish to think it would be given. I could deny you, the Treekillers could wither in my shade, cut off at the root.\" She seems amused by the thought, then dismisses it. \"Nevertheless you will have your answer. Because in doing so you will serve and perhaps die for my purposes. See now what you came to find!\"

Suddenly, images enter your mind - humans from an age long past, hacking at trees centuries old, making them fall in the blink of an eye. Treekillers. You feel a great hatred as your land is consumed. Humans with sharp metal weapons on a vast battlefield. Treekillers. You see great bioforms and A'Dendri rise up to resist the Treekillers. They meet in battle and life water feeds the soil. It is not enough though. As both armies are turned to mulch, shadows begin to rise from the ground, dark, hateful things, and beyond them a larger shadow looms over all. You see the Great Father rise to defend the land, but he too is consumed by the shadow. Hope turns to desperation and the shadow advances. As it gets closer, the dark shape comes into focus - as the blighted trunks of the Deepwood trees.

At last, a final intense picture comes to you. A cave. A cave that swallows up all light. It is the Heart of Darkness and as you stare into its depth you feel yourself drawn into its inky blackness, deeper and deeper. 

After that, the light leaves you, and with it your consciousness."</string>
    <string name="chp11b_19_9__a">"The guards had not expected that. An attack maybe, but not an unchained Oathsworn veteran taking out two of them in seconds before managing to steal an amber tipped spear from a third Pivoting in perfect form, you go to hurl it at the Matriarch.

Suddenly, spores dance before your eyes between you and your target, and you realize you can no longer move."</string>
    <string name="chp12_10_10__a">The boy snaps his head around, snarling as he hears your footsteps. He leaps to his feet, roaring a savage cry as he brandishes a tiny bone knife. This is no child on apron strings! Before you can react, he lodges the weapon into the meat of your thigh. Recoiling in a defensive stance, you now face this child as a foe.</string>
    <string name="chp12_10_10__c">A swift blow sees the child knocked unconscious, but his screams surely echoed through the tree-top village. Removing the tiny blade from your leg, you move to the edge of the platform and weigh your options.</string>
    <string name="chp12_10_11__a">On the platform to the north of you, in the shadows of the great hut, you see your companion has made fast work of a Scar Tribesman there.

High above the platform, you trace a length of drooping vines back to the boughs just above your position. Reaching for one of the wet vines, you give it a tug. It seems stable enough to hold your weight. Throwing your legs over, you begin to work your way across the expanse."</string>

His eyes have been plucked and the symbol each of you have branded on your wrists has been carved into his chest. A challenge has been issued to you. One of his arms is posed, pointing into the Deepwood. 

Not twenty paces into the Deepwood, you find another corpse posed like the first. This one is lashed to the ground by thorny vines. You peer in the direction it points. You follow a trail of corpses.

He went to get up and found his own sword held in your hand, pointing unwaveringly at his throat. It was a long moment before you let him up.

They had hoped for a cure, but had been left with another obstacle to overcome instead. A horde of monsters to get through? How to reach the unreachable? Deliberations would be needed and strategies formed.

Since taking the Oath, much of your time has been spent on the Wire. The predetermined path. An iron-forged reminder of your responsibility. Every step was the product of the one before it and every step after was laid out as though the footprints were already there. Trudging on toward the village, you return to your thoughts…

…The Broken Oak had not changed and you were glad for it. Greycane and Bram had welcomed you upon your return. Greycane shared news of the city and Bram shared a home-brewed concoction he had called 'gin', which you could only describe as 'needing work'. Midge had been there too, happy as a river rat with his own tales of Verum streetlife and all the little corners he had discovered."</string>
    <string name="chp12_1_27__a">"…Settling back into The Oak, you prepared for the inevitable nightmares that always followed long journeys into the Deepwoods. One night, hounded by dreams of being entombed in rock and earth, one of you had woken and gone to walk it off. On the landing, you had found a trail of blood spots on the floor. Following the blood, it led you to Lady Elanna's room. You knocked on the door, but got no answer. Fearing for her safety, you opened the door and were met with an odd sight. 

The demure, young noblewoman you had found fainted in the Deepwood after the Scar Tribe attack, was sitting at her dressing table cleaning something with a bloody cloth. Obviously shocked at your intrusion, she hurriedly concealed the object in a fold of her dress and turned to you accusingly."</string>
    <string name="chp12_1_28__a">"…She had been quick, very quick, but there was no doubt it had been a knife. The rest of the room was spotless.You mentioned the weapon, which gleaned a cold stare. After a moment, she explained that she met with some ruffians when going for a walk. She had taken to carrying a knife since arriving in Verum, and good thing too, as she had cause to use it that night to defend herself. You had asked what she was doing out so late, but she snapped 'it was her own business' and crossed the room to close the door in your face. You had not taken the matter further, but something was off with that woman."</string>
    <string name="chp12_1_29__a">…She had been too quick and you did not get a good look at the object she concealed. The blood stopped at the dressing table and the rest of the room was spotless. You ask about the blood and lady Elanna raised a bloody cloth to her nose. With an innocent look, she explained that she suffered nose bleeds in the cold and that she was too delicate for this climate. It became clear you were an uninvited guest in her bedroom. Making your apologies, you left. The encounter had stuck with you, and only later did you recall that the hem of her gown had been wet. You had not taken the matter further, but something was off with that woman.</string>

    <string name="chp12_1_30__a">"…In the following days, the rains receded for a time. As a Company, you went to the Green Streets carrying Guide's body, finally returning her to her people. The A'Dendri very much appreciated the gesture and a somber funeral was held amid the leaves and petals of her kin. After that, a brief respite ensued, giving you a chance to attend to your duties of mending armor and honing blades in relative comfort. That was until the raven came with the red ring.

The raven had delivered a bloodied parchment. It contained a petition for aid from a beleaguered village, claiming they were under attack. Such an occurrence was not, in itself, strange. Free Companies often found themselves contracted to protect villages from the predations of the Deepwood and were paid handsomely for doing so. This was different, though. This petition mentioned your Free Company by name.

You had never traveled to the village before, yet they called for you. It hardly mattered. Denial was not an option. The red band around the raven's foot meant the contract was not to be refused. Someone at the Raven Spire wanted that village protected. 

Realizing the danger, you had made sure to prepare well before setting out."</string>
    <string name="chp12_1_31__a">"The usual background hiss, incessant buzz of bugs, and distant growls of the Deepwood fall away as you approach the village. One of the smaller outposts of mankind, its palisade walls were erected in the hopes of a better life. With the long-standing King's Decree, many attempt to settle the woods. Each village meets with varying degrees of failure, some standing for decades, others for days. Every generation sees hundreds of hopeful families heading for the King's Gate in Verum, the promise of landright compelling them into the darkness beyond. The Decree says, 'If you can take the land, you can keep the land'. Looking at the ruin of the village, it seems something disagreed."</string>
    <string name="chp12_1_32__a">"The handful of buildings here have been purposely burned and destroyed, including the supply buildings. Any items of value have been taken. Wide weapon gashes mark the doors that litter what was once the center of the village. Men, not beasts, clearly overtook this place. 

The sound of a boot scuffed on dirt draws your attention to a large, badly burned man clutching his mangled hand as he lies against the low, stone remains of a guardhouse wall. His eyes do not meet yours as you approach. Too wounded to rise, he simply stares at his boots. His gurgling breath tells you he will not live very long.

    <string name="chp12_3_1__c">"The village is an impressive webwork of walkways and platforms situated at differing levels, all far above the dangers prowling the floor of the Deepwood. The screams of the villagers seem to come from somewhere on the large central platform, where many of the other platforms are connected. The enemy may have the advantage of the terrain, the high ground, but you still hold the element of surprise. If you split up and can pull off an ambush from multiple directions, you may have a shot at overtaking the awaiting savages and freeing the hostages. Carefully studying the construction of the platforms, you note the layout.

On the western edge of the village, you see a massive hut, most likely the Chieftain's. Overlooking the Chieftain's home, just to the south, is a tiered platform which provides an excellent vantage point over the adjacent platforms. 

Directly south of the central landing you spot what appears to be the main entrance to the treetop village. A small amber brazier illuminates the platform and an opening in the floor provides access to the forest below via a bone cage suspended by a rope pulley. 

To the Southeast you see a platform dotted with several small hide shelters, most likely the living quarters for the majority of the tribe. 

Continuing to the Eastern edge of the village you see a second large hut. This one seems more practical, with none of the adornments of the Chieftain's home. 

Lastly, as you squint through the falling rain into the boughs above, you are able to make out several climbable access routes to all of these positions. The only thing you cannot see is the enemy's whereabouts.

With your appraisal nearly complete, you note the village has actually been built against the steep face of a cliff, the location most likely chosen for the added protection the rocky mount provides. The vertical climb would take some effort and agility to ascend, but you suspect no one would think to guard a sheer wall of rock. Attacking from that direction would position you at the enemy's rear."</string>

The Scar Tribe clearly buttressed their treetop village against the rocky bluff to keep the encroaching Deepwood and most of its inhabitants out.

Those who die quickly from this plague are the lucky ones. Others seem to degenerate into twisted abominations with roots and fungus spread over their skin, driving them mad. Several good men have already been lost, and they cannot keep this up much longer. They plead with you to reduce the number of infected assailing their barricade.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_12_2__a">"The plan is to push the infected back far enough to buy some time for a few guards to rebuild a section of the flaming barricade that has been damaged by the endless assaults. You will need to hold the swarming masses at bay while ensuring you are not infected by their deadly touch.

As you step past the wall of smoke and flame, you quickly slay a few lurking infected shuffling toward the quarantine line. The guards quickly make their way down the line, heaving huge planks of timber onto the piles and erecting barriers. The effort seems to progress relatively free of danger until you spot a slow moving tide of plague-spawned walkers heading toward you. Nothing of what you see appears to be human any longer. The citizens - more like creatures now - are something conceivable only in a nightmare. Black roots and patches of dark fungus cover the bodies and limbs of the advancing horde. Sharp talon-like digits reach for you as they draw near."</string>
    <string name="chp13_12_3__a">You push and kick and hack, but there are too many. Some of the mindless things break your line, nearly pulling you under the rolling wave of bodies. Only the swift action of your companions saves you. On your feet again, you are able to hold the line long enough for the guards to reinforce the barriers. It will be easier to defend the barricade now, allowing some guards to redeploy to other areas of the city.</string>
    <string name="chp13_12_4__a">You fight them off with fire and iron. Knowing you must keep your distance from these infected creatures only makes the effort more arduous. Thankfully you are able to hold the line long enough for the guards to reinforce the barriers. It will be easier to defend the barricade now, allowing some guards to redeploy to other areas of the city.</string>
    <string name="chp13_12_5__a">"Safely behind the wall of flames once again, you watch as a small group of spearmen fight off a bulbous, blistering, spore-infested abomination with flailing black appendages. It heaves with undulating breaths, seemingly on the verge of bursting as it rampages toward them. As the soldiers lower the tips of their weapons into its diseased flesh, the creature explodes in a noxious cloud of black spores that quickly envelopes the men. Their nearby brethren look on with horrified expressions before swiftly putting them down as well - a kindness considering what fate awaited them. You note what happened here and will be ready the next time you are faced with such a creature.

    <string name="chp13_13_1__a">"As usual, the Market is a bustling den of life, except for the fact that it is now home to many of Verum's displaced citizens, most of whom have fled from the quarantine districts. The mood is tenuous here, but there are still several merchants peddling their wares."</string>
    <string name="chp13_13_1__c">"A low rumble suddenly rises from behind the wall to the northwest, as wailing and screams grow louder and louder. The crowd here pauses, bending a frightened ear toward the noise. Whispered anxiety spreads like wildfire amongst those gathered, and you soon hear panicked cries as some fear the wall is about to be breached. A few steal food or merchandise from vendors' carts. Others grab what little possessions they have and start to flee. You cannot risk a stampede here or allow one or two ignorant naysmiths to panic an entire city with their unjustified fears. You quickly hop upon a wooden crate and call out to the masses in the square."</string>
    <string name="chp13_13_2__a">The crowd grows silent at the sight of your commanding presence. Frightened, empty eyes stare up at you, but there is recognition in many of them. Those within earshot listen to the truth in your words as you tell them they must be brave and stand together now. This city has only begun to fight, and there is not a single man or woman who is ready to lie down and die. This is their city, and they will conquer this plague. Your words are met with some cheers and enough relaxed smiles to bring a hint of hope to the people. They are going to need it if the infected souls pressing against that wall truly do break through.</string>
    <string name="chp13_13_3__a">"Despite your pleas, the crowd largely ignores you. People have begun to panic and fights are breaking out everywhere over scraps of rotten food or other wares. With the help of some nearby City Guards you are able to quell the squabbles, but in the end you realize it is only a matter of time before the flames of fear spread into a raging inferno.

Arriving at the former riverbed bisecting the city, you find long lines of refugees fleeing the muddy basin. There is an evacuation underway. Speaking with one of the attending guards you learn that piles of hay and sacks of amber are going to be stacked down there. Apparently they plan to set the Gutters on fire if the quarantine should break.

    <string name="chp13_19_1__a">A small contingent of City Guards protect the Banksmith, shoving angry citizens away from the hot, smokey forge. When you speak with the Banksmith he tells you the King has ordered all trade to halt, except for the needs of any Free Companymen or guards. What precious resources there are left in this city must be reserved for those who are most critical to protecting its people.</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_10__a">Putting together what you know, it seems the Stone Dogs were contracted by this warden to aid in the recapture of the witch. Further questioning of the guards outside Black Rock reveals they were last seen heading northwest. A witch could hide in any number of places throughout Verum, but you have a few ideas where to look first. Whatever happened, there is a missing Free Company and an escaped Witch that must be found quickly.</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_1__a">"The fortress known as Black Rock Prison towers before you. Once the residence of the royal family, the castle is now headquarters to the Inquisition and home to Verum's dungeons. The castle draws its name from the miniature mountain of black rock that it was constructed upon centuries ago. 

Your Oathmarks grant you passage onto the premises where you are promptly greeted by the prison's governor, an Inquisitor who is only too eager to flaunt the vastness of the sprawling, inescapable web of dungeons he commands.

\"Allow me to show you, Oathsworn, how the other hand of the King's might operates,\" the Inquisitor declares. He leads you down into the first block of dark, damp dungeons, waving a gloved hand at row upon row of heavy dark iron doors. \"Interrogation cells. I have overseen the confessions of thousands during my tenure here. Few Inquisitors can match proficiency in duty, as I have.\"

As the Inquisitor leads you deeper into the prison's depths, a terrified scream echoes from the corridor ahead."</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_2__a">The dark stone hallways and chambers stir memories you had hoped were long forgotten. Tugging at the dark iron collar at your throat, an old nightmare flashes in your mind. You know all too well the predations that occur in these dungeons. Bodies, minds, souls, everything can be broken down here. And should you prove strong enough to survive, they will only remake you into something which suits their purpose.</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_3__a">There is no place in the world you would rather avoid than this forsaken hellhole. Unfortunately, if you tried to scheme some excuse to remain outside, it might only draw unwanted suspicion, so you have no choice but to follow your group down into the belly of the beast. A shiver runs down your spine as the cold amber-lit hallways stir memories you had hoped were long forgotten.</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_4__a">"Though your life prior to Black Rock may be a formless void, you remember your time here very well. Many times have you passed down these corridors, donned in your battlegear escorting the 'tainted ones'. Some may presume you had taken the Oath just to escape the incessant screamings down here, but you know the truth. Your Oath had been a reward. A token of trust earned by loyalty, discipline and blood."</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_5__a">"The Inquisitor leads you ever deeper into the dungeons. Down, through the cell blocks with normal prisoners, deeper and deeper into the bowels of Black Rock, you finally reach the inquisitorial level. 

\"Our cells are unfortunately empty at the moment,\" the Inquisitor tells you. \"We are diligently interrogating suspected witches, however we have found none thus far. We will not fail in our mandate, I can assure you. Allow me to show you something interesting.\"

He brings you to a lightless, circular chamber where a man has been strung up by his wrists, hanging over a vast pit. Kicking a small stone, you wait for the sound of it reaching the bottom, but the sound never comes. The Inquisitor smiles at you, then motions toward a small sconce where a burning candle tickles at the rope holding the prisoner above the abyss.

\"Notice the arrangement of jars around the room,\" he says, pointing toward several glass containers that sit in evenly spaced intervals around the chamber. \"They contain most of the known elements witches manipulate with their abilities. This ritual allows us to not only verify the taint upon one's soul, but also determine the nature of their affinities. The flame at the rope is merely used to encourage brevity. Nothing brings out the malefic quite like the threat of death.\"

Peering into the endless pit, you imagine what happens to those who fail to display powers.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_6__a">"\"Cruelty?\" the Inquisitor chuckles. \"Necessity. Humanity is at stake here. We must find witches, and so we follow every lead.\" As he escorts you from the chamber, you broach the subject of the missing Free Company.

\"Ah. Well, let's see what we can find regarding these Stone Dogs,\" he says pushing the heavy iron door shut behind you. Suddenly, you hear the fading screams of the man you saw as he plunges into the pit."</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_7__a">\"Straight to the point. As you Oathsworn usually are,\" he says as he escorts you from the chamber, pushing the heavy iron door shut behind you. Suddenly, you hear the fading screams of the man you saw as he plunges into the pit.</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_8__a">"\"Ah yes!\" he says with an excited grin. \"The process has been refined over decades. We can now identify every witch brought to us, both accurately and expeditiously.\" As he escorts you from the chamber, you broach the subject of the missing Free Company.

\"Well then, let's see what we can find regarding these Stone Dogs,\" he says, pushing the heavy iron door shut behind you. Suddenly, you hear the fading screams of the man you saw as he plunges into the pit."</string>
    <string name="chp13_20_9a__a">"Searching through stacks of log books and records, the Inquisitor finds no mention of the Stone Dogs. He does however find an entry by a warden around the time the Free Company went missing. As he reads the handwritten note, his eyes go wide with shock. \"This warden states he has gone on… a recovery mission,\" he gasps. \"How can this be possible? No one escapes Black Rock.\"

The entry goes on to speak of a witch this warden had apprehended named Marcella. Apparently, at the time of this event, she was the only witch in custody beneath Black Rock."</string>
    <string name="chp13_22_1__a">"An ominous, blue haze floats in the air around the Raven Spire. The amber torches and braziers dotting its stone exterior add a gritty maleficence to its bearing which only grows more unsettling as you approach the tower gates. A pair of dark iron golems stand watch at either side of the closed portcullis, lifeless eyes dart out from behind their dark face guards. The scene here is all but unaffected by the epidemic ravaging the city.

Standing before the gates, you are greeted by a serf of some kind, bald-headed with bleached white skin. The man seems to already have one foot in the grave. After explaining your purpose, you are denied entry, however the serf agrees to pass your request along to his masters. A short time later, the serf returns, handing you an opened scroll displaying an Oathmark seal.

\"My masters were presented with this petition by a Warden of the Inquisition. It is a requisition for assignment of a Free Company. The Stone Dogs. No other details were offered. It seems the specifics were only to be provided to the Oathsworn by the petitioning Warden himself.\""</string>

    <string name="chp13_28_10__c">"Your Warden steps forward, leading your witch by the collar, and volunteers her for the task. 

\"Thank you, Oathsworn,\" praises the King. \"Your sacrifice is most honorable. But I cannot permit such a valuable asset to be wasted so readily. I am told there is still time to locate others and if what you say is true, we will need far more than just a single witch. Only if we are unsuccessful in our attempt to find additional cursed souls will I ask you to make such a sacrifice.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_11__a">"Standing before his throne, the King addresses the assembly once again.

\"I hereby order each Free Company in the realm to hunt and collar every witch they can find. No rumor shall be dismissed and no quarter given. We must scour the lands. It is a bloody task, and not one I command lightly. But I am certain that if I do not, I would be ensuring the deaths of thousands and the loss of our great city. You shall have until the new moon. At that time, we shall march into the Heart of Darkness, witches or not. We have only one chance to succeed. Failure is not an option.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_12__c">"Your witch steps before the assembled crowd, \"I volunteer.\"

The words send a shock down your spine as all eyes turn to your companion. Muffled chatter rises as the Lord Inquisitor calls for your witch to be shackled immediately. You share a pleading stare with your battle-sister.

\"Thank you, Oathsworn,\" praises the King. \"Your sacrifice is most honorable. But I would not permit such a valuable asset to be wasted so readily. I am told there is still time to locate others of your kind, and if what you say is true, we will need far more than just a single witch. We should exhaust every other resource before considering such a heavy cost.\"

With a raised gauntlet, the King silences the crowd again. \"Anyone who would sacrifice themself for the good of the realm is no enemy of the crown,\" he says. \"This woman is already a hero to us all. Therefore she is now under my protection, Lord Inquisitor. I would have you personally ensure no harm comes to her.\" 

The crowd erupts with whispers and more than a few snide remarks. While the King may be the highest authority in the realm, his power resides in the recognition of and adherence to tradition. To openly protect a witch flies in the face of not only those traditions, but also goes against the teachings of the church. The young monarch will almost assuredly lose support for the gesture, yet he nods proudly at your witch."</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_13__a">"\"We volunteer our witch, your Majesty.\" 

Your Witch's eyes turn deathly cold as the words send a buzz through the crowd. All eyes turn to you and your companion. The Lord Inquisitor calls for your witch to be shackled immediately, while the King appears somewhat saddened by your choice.

\"My thanks to you, Oathsworn. Your sacrifice knows no bounds,\" says the King. \"Lord Inquisitor. This lady shall not be harmed until necessary. See that she is well looked after until the time comes. We owe her that much.\" Turning back to you he continues, \"More souls will be needed but the task is made easier by what you have done\"."</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_14__a">A silent look shared amongst the group makes your decision clear. You will not give up your own, no matter the cost. As pleas for a witch rise, you remain silent.</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_15__a">"As the assembled crowd reacts to the King's decree, you spot a familiar face mixed in with the others present. Elanna shifts nervously as she speaks with her noble acquaintances. The young woman has been avoiding you since the incident in her room, spending less and less time at The Broken Oak. You resolve to speak with her after your audience with the King. 

Suddenly, you notice the subtle impression of concealed weapons strapped to each of her thighs. Thin profile blades, such as those required for concealment, do not come cheap and are certainly not the kind of weapon a local Blacksmith could supply."</string>

    <string name="chp13_28_17__a">"Calling an end to the council, the King departs with the Watchers in tow. Almost immediately, Guard Captain Trent calls out to you, waving you over to where he stands.

\"I have no reservation telling you, Verum is on the brink of collapse,\" he says. \"Order must be restored, otherwise there won't be a city left to save.\"

The Captain's words ring with truth. If Verum falls into chaos before you have a chance to eradicate the plague, all will be for naught. You ask the Captain what must be done. 

\"There is a Free Company called The Stone Dogs, who are well known for their connections throughout all levels of society here,\" he tells you. \"They could be of great assistance in our efforts to maintain peace within the city walls. However, they have been missing for some time. I am not aware of them traveling elsewhere or falling in the Deepwood, so they must be somewhere in the city. Verum may be a massive city, but a whole Free Company cannot just disappear here. If you can find them, we may be able to quiet the calls for rebellion and buy some time.\" 

You nod in understanding, and consider what might have become of the missing Oathsworn. Before the Captain takes his leave, he offers a final bit of advice. \"Be mindful of the Green Streets. The A'Dendri have barricaded themselves in. Something is not right there.\"

It seems you have plenty to worry about at the moment - a city on the verge of collapse, rumors of a missing Free Company, and suspicious A'Dendri. You can feel it's going to be one of those days."</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_18__c">"As you descend the steps of the Palace entryway, you spot Elanna hurriedly crossing the courtyard. This is your best opportunity to confront her. Exiting the royal estate, you shadow the woman through the noble quarters, your mind sifting through the strange events that have surrounded her. The blood on the cloth in her room, the way she seems to vanish without a trace, the daggers you noticed hidden beneath her dress. How she has always wanted to be close to the King…

Following her down a side alley, you call out her name, and Elanna turns with a demure smile. \"Have you come to escort a lady across the city?\" For the briefest moment, you swear there is a flit of danger in her eyes, but it is gone in a flash. With a serious glare, you confront Elanna about her strange behavior, telling her you believe she conceals some hidden motive. She seems genuinely astonished by your insinuations, insulted even. 

\"How can you say such things?\" she gasps. \"I nearly died fleeing Bastone! I've lost everything and everyone who ever mattered to me. I'm barely acknowledged by these entitled curs, who call themselves 'nobility' and now you accuse me of… of what exactly?\"

Perhaps she is right. Being so on-edge, is it possible you are seeing danger where there is none? Would you truly question a woman of such noble bearing? On the other hand, your suspicions have kept you alive this long. There is no sense in doubting them now."</string>

    <string name="chp13_28_1__a">"The Palace

As you enter, the Palace's Throne Room is buzzing with conversation and speculation. Every noble, knight and lord in the city has been summoned, including three or four additional Free Companies. With only a few dozen still serving throughout the realm, the presence of more than one Free Company is a rare sight. 

Settling into a quiet viewing place, you mark the other Oathsworn. The Brothers of the Wolf, The Ebon Company, The Ironclad and even the infamous Red Watch huddled together in a group. All have an impressive tally, worthy of respect. You return a nod to the leader of the Ironclad and move your gaze to the King.

Flanked by a small cadre of Watchers as usual, the boy King sits resplendent upon his throne in full battle gear. This will be no ordinary council meeting. The young King silences the crowd with a simple gesture of his gold-trimmed gauntlet. 

\"Lords and ladies. The crown thanks you for coming at such short notice. I wish to dispense with formalities and get to the heart of the matter. Verum is in peril. Our efforts to stay the plague ravaging our city have failed and the quarantine lines are on the verge of collapse. I'm afraid if we do not find a solution quickly, the city will descend into chaos and ruin. We stand at the precipice.\"

The crowd murmurs with anxious exchanges, eliciting another raised hand from the King.

\"I have ordered all Free Companies to return to Verum immediately as we make plans for what may be our last stand. Our last hope.\" The King rises from his throne, stretching his armored hand toward your group. \"Thanks to our Oathsworn, we have discovered the origin of humanity's greatest nightmare. The Heart of the Deepwood.\"

All eyes turn toward you, stunned gasps and chatter fill the Great Hall.

\"It is believed that by cutting the heart from these cursed woods we can stop the plague and rid our world of the choking hands the Deepwood has had around our throats for generations. But it will not come without pain. And death. This Heart of Darkness is surrounded by monstrosities and creatures beyond counting. We will have to fight our way through them if we hope to succeed.\"

You watch as a dagger flies from her hand, stabbing toward your heart. You see the young King, lying in a pool of blood. With a shiver, your senses leap to another skein of reality. The same dagger rockets toward you again. No matter where you search, all paths lead to the same moment. A flying dagger, the boy King, blood pooling beneath his corpse. And Verum, burning in ruin. 

Waking from your vision, you see Elanna's once demure countenance now red with rage. The veil of a noble woman lifted at last. Informed by your premonition, you dodge her attack before the dagger has hardly left her hand. As the weapon flies past, your taloned claw clutches her by the throat and slams her body to the ground.

    <string name="chp13_28_21__c">"Moving with acrobatic grace and blazing speed, her well-honed muscles power her escape. Your suspicions had you well prepared however, and you catch her before she has a chance to scale the stone wall at the end of the alleyway.

Then in one fluid motion, Elanna tears off the skirt of her dress and leaps into the air, bounding from one wall edge to the next, scaling the stone blockade with ease. She moves with an acrobatic grace and blazing speed you have never seen. As she alights a nearby rooftop, she pauses and looks back. 

\"The Guild thanks you, Oathsworn!\" she calls out, her once demure Bastonian tongue replaced by a harsh Thracian accent. 

A sense of foreboding fills your mind, but it will have to wait. There are more pressing matters you must deal with immediately, namely bringing order to the city and finding witches for The Keening."</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_23__a">"\"I mean you no harm, Oathsworn,\" she pleads in submission. \"I only wish to protect myself.\"

You study the woman's expression, searching for the truth. She just tried to kill you, but perhaps she was only acting in self-defense. After a moment, you release your grip, setting her free. As she gets up, Elanna tears off the skirt of her dress and leaps into the air, bounding from one wall edge to the next, scaling the stone blockade with ease. She moves with an acrobatic grace and blazing speed you have never seen. As she alights a nearby rooftop, she pauses and looks back with a devilish grin.

    <string name="chp13_28_25__a">"This woman is shrouded in deceit and what little facts you are able to glean from her tells you she is a killer and a professional. There is no telling how many would die if you were to let her go. With a quick flash of your dagger, you end Elanna's life. 

As the blood trickles over her intricately embroidered corset, you study the dagger tucked in her boot. Its ornate craftsmanship and design are unmistakable to one with a knowledge of blades. It is a 'Thracian kiss', the favored weapon of the Assassin's Guild in Thrace."</string>
    <string name="chp13_28_26__c">"You follow the gaolers down into the dungeons beneath Black Rock Prison, ensuring Elanna is securely locked up.

    <string name="chp13_28_27__a">"Handing Elanna over to the Royal Guards, you are sure to tell them she is dangerous and must be handled with caution. As they lead her away, you hear the men quip about your warnings and see a grin stretch across Elanna's face. Giving such a dangerous prisoner over to the guards may not have been the safest choice, but you have more pressing matters to attend to. As you head back into the city, you take a closer look at the dagger you confiscated from her, noting the subtle patterns etched into its surface. Its ornate craftsmanship and design are unmistakable to one with a knowledge of blades. It is a 'Thracian kiss', the favored weapon of the Assassin's Guild in Thrace. You quickly realize your mistake and run back to where you left Elanna with the guard squad.

She must have infiltrated Bastone as a noble's ward, then made her way to Verum under your protection. Once here, she most likely set out gathering information about the city's defenses and the palace's weaknesses, with it all culminating in your confrontation today. You may not yet know who she was sent to kill, but her Guild is known only to deal in 'high value targets'. 

However, that must all wait for the time being. There are more pressing matters you must deal with immediately, namely bringing order to the city and finding witches for The Keening.

\"The infected, they're not human no more. They've changed into something else,\" one of them tells you.

\"That's not the worst of it though,\" another adds. \"A few days ago they started coming in waves. Every time we kill one, there's two more to take their place. Been attacking the line like that ever since.\" 

The guards have no intention of stopping you from heading into the plague-ridden district, your Oathmark is permission enough.

Moving past one group, you step over the remains of a man and woman, twisted together in their dying embrace and contorted by the growths covering them.

As you head deeper, a glance at your hand forces a grim realization. Gathering on your armor and weapons is a black dust you thought was only ashes from the burning pyres. If only you were so lucky!

Attempts to engage the frightened citizens are pointless as they disappear into their dark homes the moment you call out. 

Sliding down another street, you luckily spot a hand waving you over to a tanner's shop. The woman who greets you inside is armed with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other.

\"I know why you're here,\" she says. \"Oathsworn, right? Well, promise me safe passage and I'll tell you what I know.\" You agree. 

\"Said they were the Stone Dogs,\" she continues. \"Asking for some woman I seen a few days back, Marcella. Poor thing, all alone. But I'll tell you the same as I told them. She took off heading for her home. Since then I've been stuck here, beatin' back the wood damned infected as best I can.\"

As she finishes, a twisted thing with long, flail-like vines for arms breaks through the door. You quickly slash at the creature with your weapons, but the woman steps forward with a shout. \"Stand back!\" She buries a flaming torch in the monstrosity's gut, setting it aflame. The thing recoils in terror, running off down the street. \"Some of them fear fire,\" she says. \"Others don't.\"

Around a corner, you find a mob of infected clawing at the walls of a small building. Bodies are piled in the doors and windows of the simple home, but the plague-ridden creatures press against them, desperately trying to reach whatever lies inside. 

Suddenly, you see a spray of arrows take down the front rank of the infected. As the bodies fall you catch sight of A'Dendri Rangers crouched inside nocking arrows into their branch-like bows. This must be the missing group you learned of. They are thankfully alive, but pinned down. You wonder why they had not simply scaled the building and climbed the wall to escape, and then you see the reason why. Huddled behind the Rangers is a cohort of injured human survivors. The A'Dendri had chosen to stay and defend them rather than flee. 

As you approach, you watch as an A'Dendri lets loose a fully drawn arrow right into the face of an infected. The thing explodes in a shower of spores, the spores thankfully missing nearby humans. You must act fast.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_2__a">You understand the danger, but see no better option. Drawing your weapons, you charge the corrupted mass of bodies, easily cutting down dozens before the mob reacts.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_2__c">One infected after another falls beneath your savage blows as you advance toward the door of the small house. From the huddled mass, another one of the bloated mushroom-covered creatures arises, lumbering toward you. Your attack pierces the grotesque monstrosity in the gut and the thing explodes, showering spores and bits of infected flesh over everyone. In the press of close combat, you swing and slash with everything you have, finishing off the last of the plagued civilians. With the mob defeated, you take the moment to wipe clean your gear. The mess comes off easily enough, but there is no telling what damage the spore-ridden air in your lungs may have done. You block the thought from your mind as you head for the door.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_3__a">"An abandoned merchant's cart stands nearby. Putting your amber torch to it, the timber bursts into an orange inferno. The heat's haze blurs your vision and flames nearly lick your face as you position yourself behind the cart and push."</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_4__a">Ducking down the back alley, you traverse the rubble and debris of former buildings and eventually arrive at what you believe is the rear of the small house. Inspecting the structure, you search for weak points.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_5__a">"The A'Dendri waste no time quickly moving survivors out the door as you arrive. Aiding those too weak to move, you help the injured humans out of the quarantined district and back to the safety of the Green Streets. Hopefully word of your actions will soon spread and restore some measure of hope to the beleaguered city."</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_6__a">The cart rocks on its axle then begins to roll. Faster and faster, a wall of fire careens toward the mob. Diseased bodies scatter in all directions, terrified of the flames. The rolling fireball crashes into those not quick enough to move out of the way and the flames ignite their flesh like matchwood. Among them are some of the larger mushroom-covered creatures, which explode the moment fire engulfs them. With the path now clear, you head for the house.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_7__a">The cart rocks on its axle, but does not budge. The commotion draws the attention of some nearby infected who slowly begin to amble toward you. Time is running out. With everything you have, you give the cart one last heave. Muscles strain and twitch under the effort and you swear you feel something inside you tear as the cart finally begins to move.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_7__c">Faster and faster the flaming cart rolls toward the mob. Diseased bodies scatter in all directions, terrified of the flames. The rolling fireball crashes into those not quick enough to move out of the way, the flames igniting their flesh like matchwood. Among them are some of the larger mushroom-covered creatures, which explode the moment fire engulfs them. With the path now clear, you head for the house.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_8__a">With weapons and fists you batter and claw at the wall. Chunks fly and the wall begins to come apart. Seizing the moment you take a run up and drive your shoulder through the wall, collapsing a hole large enough to squeeze through.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_8__c">"Blinking through the dust, you see the shocked faces of survivors, while the A'Dendri Rangers battle a fresh wave of infected who have regrouped with renewed savageness. Seizing the moment, you drag the humans out through the newly renovated rear wall just as the front door caves in. The Rangers are forced to give ground and immediately aid you with moving the survivors out of the quarantined district. Before long you are back in the relative safety of the Green Streets. Hopefully word of your actions will soon spread and restore some measure of hope to the beleaguered city."</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_9__a">With weapons held tight, you smash and batter the wall. Chunks fly as it comes apart and you begin to hear screams coming from within. You are running out of time. Seizing the moment you take a run at the wall, driving your shoulder into the rock and masonry. Your muscles strain and you think you feel something tear inside you but the wall collapses, leaving a hole large enough to squeeze through.</string>
    <string name="chp13_3_9__c">"With time running out, another member of your team makes a second charge at the wall, opening a large hole. Blinking through the dust, you see the shocked faces of survivors while the A'Dendri Rangers battle a fresh wave of infected who have regrouped with renewed savageness. Seizing the moment, you drag the humans out through the newly renovated rear wall just as the front door caves in. The Rangers are forced to give ground and immediately aid you with moving the survivors out of the quarantined district. Before long you are back in the relative safety of the Green Streets. Hopefully word of your actions will soon spread and restore some measure of hope to the beleaguered city."</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_10__a">"Having escaped the dictatorship of the Wychwood's Matriarch, the A'Dendri refugees have opted for a more democratic form of governance in the Green Streets. Using the Knock, you are able to secure an audience with the Elder Council. 

Your command of the Knock has improved since your last A'Dendri encounter and it serves you well during your diplomatic visit here. Hoping to get to the heart of the matter, you ask the council why it has sealed off the area from the rest of the city behind a massive wall. They explain the harsh treatment they have experienced since the coming of the plague by Verum's populace. Because the pandemic has had no effect on the A'Dendri, most humans blame them for the pestilence killing them. The harassment has taken a toll, not only on morale, but also in loss of life. 

Escorting you to what could only be described as a graveyard, they show you just how severe the toll has been. Lining the base of their towering wooden barricade are row upon row of beautiful white flowers, each representing an A'Dendri life lost to the violence. \"We surrounded. We need help,\" one of the elders taps. \"Will you observe our danger?\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_11__a">You hear the angry shouting before you even reach the eastern wall. Looking down from the ramparts, you observe a mob of humans hurling promises of violence as they wave amber torches and makeshift weapons at the Rangers lining the top of the barricade. The crowd appears to be maintaining a safe distance for the time being, but you know these walls will not hold if they find enough courage or desperation to charge.</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_12__a">"From the top of the western wall, you overlook what once was a vibrant part of the city. Now it is known as the plague district. The stench of death and decay is suffocating. Pyres smolder on every street with charred corpses and plague victims scattered about. Some appear to still be moving. Your A'Dendri hosts tell you how the infected have been trying to break through the wall here as well. The plague has somehow changed them and individuals mindlessly attack the wall with branch and bone. 

\"Rangers search plague streets for survivors,\" an elder knocks. \"Attacked. Now trapped. You are friend to A'Dendri. Will you help find Rangers?\"

Looking down into the plague-ridden district you are loath to consider the dangers of setting foot in the stinking hellhole. However, helping them get their warriors back would go a long way to easing race relations. The plague is said to only spread through contact, and you do have long weapons to defend yourselves with. Still, the trip would be a perilous one."</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_13__a">"There are certainly opportunities here to help calm the city's tensions. The mob assailing the eastern wall has no idea the Green Streets are acting as a bulwark protecting them from the plague. And the A'Dendri's natural immunity allows them to guard the plague district's borders, ensuring it does not spread. Perhaps explaining this to the angry humans would diffuse the situation. There is also the matter of the missing A'Dendri Rangers. If the rescue party has found human survivors, this act may help put an end to the aggression Verum's people are exhibiting toward the A'Dendri.


Choose a location to go to:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_1__a">"A towering wall of naturally grown wood and spikes rises before you, enclosing the A'Dendri sector in a living barricade. Hundreds of human corpses lie at the base of the structure, many still clutching weapons in their cold dead hands. Patrolling the top of the wall are dozens of Rangers, each with arrows knocked into their self-grown bows, scanning the streets for threats. Things seem to have escalated quickly here. The A'Dendri would have been left with no option but to defend themselves.

As you draw near, all arrows quickly turn toward you, prepared to fire. Suddenly, one of the Rangers relaxes her aim, and is soon followed by the others. A stream of yellow spores floats behind the wall to the ground below and a section of the wall peels back, opening a doorway to the Green Streets beyond. An awaiting Ranger waves you in. It seems that your noble gesture of returning Guide's body to her people has secured your standing among the A'Dendri, allowing you to freely walk among them now."</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_7__a">"As you walk the verdant neighborhoods, you find the Green Streets have changed dramatically since you were last here. The once peaceful nature reserve has been transformed into heavily fortified barracks. Rows of small, bioformed structures line several streets, each housing injured A'Dendri warriors. Rangers patrolling the western walls adjacent to Verum's most heavily impacted plague districts fire arrow after arrow down toward infected citizens threatening the safety of this living cityscape. 

You find it hard to fault their defensive posture considering the rampant xenophobia and heightened anxiety caused by the plague's deadly touch. These people are refugees in a city which wants little to do with them, and they have nowhere else to turn. What can they do, but defend what little territory they have left in this world? Simply uprooting is not an option for them."</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_8__a">"Continuing your walk through the refugee district, you come upon a remarkable scene of soft leafy canopies and delicately woven archways. Vines and twisting stems flow from one building to the next like living walkways. Ornate sculptures of living wood and flowers dot the landscape with a likeness not even a master stone sculptor could match. At the heart of it all is your companion, the Broken Ranger. Since returning to the city, she has spent much of her time here and it seems her disability has allowed other abilities to grow in its place. While she may no longer be able to make arrows from her own body like other rangers she has found the means to encourage growth in other plants. Looking around you know she is responsible for much of the artisanship you are seeing and has gained quite the following among her kin.

Placing a weapon into her hands may have briefly given her life meaning, but it seems she has found something else here. Even with her inhuman, expressionless face, the happiness in her eyes is obvious and you realize you have a tough decision to make.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_4_9__a">"The Broken Ranger's eyes alight as you approach and she greets you with a slight bow of the head. Using The Knock, you tap out a heartfelt message of thanks and explain that you wish to release her from her oath. She suddenly envelops you in a burst of spores from her hair. A wave of joy and a sense of connectedness washes over you like nothing you have ever felt before. Soon, other A'Dendri gather around, capturing the shared spores and basking in the moment. The day you found her she was a broken Ranger, but since her arrival in the Green Streets she has been called 'Evergreen' by her people and has become a symbol of hope to them. Your gesture today seems to have given them cause for celebration."</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_1__a">"Arriving at the Underways, you find a procession of thousands of cattle being driven out of the cavernous depths by dozens of City Guards. When you ask what is happening, the Sergeant explains the plague has now spread underground. Since the Underways network of tunnels branches beneath the entire city, including the plague district, it was only a matter of time until someone found a way to breach them. The guards are now fighting an underground battle as well, and their plan is to evacuate the cattle so they can collapse the tunnel and seal the infected masses within. You know there is precious little time to waste, but helping these men secure the entrance will surely increase their morale.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_2__a">"If the infected here get to the surface there is no telling how many could die. You quickly help the soldiers drive the cattle on and set amber charges to the thick timber columns holding up the tunnel entrance. As the last of the cattle are driven through, you grab a flaming torch and stand ready. Moments later, a band of guards appears from the gloomy depths engaged in a fighting retreat. From the shadows beyond, you see a wave of infected humans piling over one another as they claw their way toward the entrance. Three more guards are pulled beneath the rolling tide and as the defensive line begins to break, one of the soldiers calls out the order to 'Run'. 

Suddenly, another wave of infected citizens emerges from a side tunnel and shuffles toward you. The new threat will reach the entrance before the retreating guards and by the looks on the terrified guards' faces, they realize it as well. \"Wait!\" one soldier screams. \"Please!\" But there is no time for deliberation. Your only options are to blow the entrance now, entombing the guards along with the infected, or cut your way to the guards and drag them out yourself."</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_4__a">One of you charges into the darkness of the tunnel, and where one goes, you all go. Drawing your weapons, you rush after them and meet the infected head on, battering aside plagued bodies and cutting them down to reach the guards beyond. The fighting is chaotic and dangerous with the fear of being touched ever present.</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_5__a">As your gaze flits between the pleading faces of the guards and the deformed visages of the infected surging toward you, it becomes clear that there is no choice but to blow the tunnel entrance. The guards were already dead the moment the second wave broke through. Tossing the flaming torch onto the pile of amber charges, the ensuing explosion blinds you in a wash of white light, rocking your bones. When your vision returns, you see dust rising from the collapsed tunnel. The sound of muffled screams beneath the rubble soon fades, however the memory never will. At least the city is safe for now, and the remaining guards can be repositioned to other areas where they may be needed.</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_5__c">As you leave the Underways, you lament the extreme measures needed to hold back the infected masses. If the city survives this plague, much effort will be required to re-open the caverns. Verum will not survive for long without this crucial source of food and water supplies.</string>
    <string name="chp13_5_6__a">You carve a bloody path to the surviving guards as they struggle to stay ahead of the pursuing wave of infected behind them. Pulling and dragging the weak and weary toward the light, you count the remaining paces. Ten… Five… Two… You burst into the light just as an explosion rocks your world. You are flung through the air and land in a heap several yards beyond the tunnel. With your senses slowly returning, you look back to see dust rising from the collapsed entryway. Thankfully, it seems at least a dozen guards have survived.</string>

    <string name="chp13_5_7__a">Carving a bloody path to the surviving guards, you are barely able to keep ahead of the incoming wave of infected citizens. You quickly grab the weakest and drag them toward the light as others execute a fighting retreat. Ten paces. Five paces. Two. You burst into daylight, just as an explosion rocks the world around you, knocking you off your feet and sending you hurtling you through the air. Picking yourselves up off the ground, you turn to see dust rising from the collapsed entrance to the tunnel. Luckily your efforts were at least somewhat successful, as you see more than a dozen guards still alive.</string>

    <string name="chp13_6_1__a">The macabre scene at the Apothecary turns your stomach. What had once been a shop full of herbs and ointments has become an abattoir. You find a number of herbalists resecting samples of flesh from deceased plague victims while others examine bodies. Shocked so many would dare touch the afflicted, one of the apothecaries informs you they have recently learned the plague dies with the host and the dead are no longer infectious. Looking around the shop, you notice people in different stages of the affliction. Some have only a few black spots on their skin, while others have huge branch-like protrusions or whitish-yellow mushrooms hanging off their bodies in clumps.</string>
    <string name="chp13_6_1__c">"Looking over the different bodies, one in particular catches your attention. The woman is completely overgrown by some form of bark, almost like a suit of armor. You can only imagine that fighting such a thing is hard and will need some well timed stabs to get into the cracks between the armor.

    <string name="chp13_7_1__a">"A hard rain patters against the window panes of The Broken Oak. The water quenches the memories of fire and screams of villagers in cages. With a week of rest between you and the Scar Tribe Village, your wounds have had a chance to heal and your aches have lessened, thanks in no small part to Bram's ministrations, some of his concoctions make for good anesthetics."</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_1__c">"The crowds at The Oak have lessened since your return, with fewer patrons visiting the establishment every day. Word has spread of the deteriorating conditions throughout the city and there is a growing sense of hopelessness. According to Greycane's network of whispers, there will soon be a council meeting with the King and you will be summoned to attend. 

As your group shares a simple breakfast of ale and soft breads, Greycane regales you with the latest news from the Chief Apothecary.

\"Spores,\" Greycane says with a puckered sneer, as if he had just kissed the wrong end of a horse. \"That's how the plague spreads. The apothecaries say the infected have patches of spores all over their bodies. It's passed by touching them.\" He shivers at the thought, \"Get those things on you and you're a marked man.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_2__a">"During your breakfast conversation, Gamel the Banksmith approaches your table. The grief of his lost son is clearly weighing on him. The memory of the boy's death on the tree in the Satyr's den is still fresh in your mind. These bouts of sorrow have come and gone since his escape from Bastone and this looks to be a bad one. The distraught man stands over your table, trying his best to compose himself despite the tear in his eye \"I… I keep playing that night over and over in my mind,\" he says. \"I see how you look at me. There's something you're not telling me. I need to know. What happened to my son?\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_3__a">"You find it difficult to lie to the distraught man, but with him under the burden of so much grief, the truth may cause more harm than good. The most important thing at this moment is to keep your Company united. 

Gamel nods, fighting back the tears. \"Apologies, Oathsworn. It gets the better of me sometimes. You took me in and I owe you. Think I'd crack if it weren't for my work. I've been making improvements to my field gear with the things we learned on our travels from Bastone in mind. I would be happy to make the same modifications to the other lads' equipment if you can help cover the cost.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_4__a">"Gamel deserves the truth. As you utter the words, you see the man's heart break before you. \"You killed my boy? You?!\" Gamel snaps.

The Banksmith draws his hammer from the loop on his apron, swinging it wildly with rage. Your attempts to reason with him are useless as you scatter from the man's attacks. Muscles built up over a lifetime at the forge twitch with fury and the look in Gamel's eyes tells you he is lost to rage. The more you plead with him, the less you feel you are getting through. He will not be dissuaded. It is as if he is begging you to end his misery. With no other option, you make a swift killing blow."</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_4__c">"A shocked silence hangs in the air, disbelief and sadness everywhere. Tam's death has always weighed heavily on everyone's mind. You made a choice and must bear the consequences. This is what it means to be Oathsworn, but it doesn't make it any easier today. Greycane gives you a look, a decision of his own being made in that moment. Then, with a nod of his head, he calls for guards to remove the body. 

\"He was a good man,\" Greycane offers. \"And he loved his son.\" The Fableman reflects for a moment as his body is carried away, a silent prayer to a fallen ally.

\"Before… this, Gamel told me he'd been working on some improvements to the field gear,\" he continues. \"I believe I can find another smith to make the modifications to the other lads' equipment if you're willing to cover the cost. I'm sure he wouldn't want his work to go to the grave with him.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_7__a">"The atmosphere in the common room of The Broken Oak is solemn. Noting the tension, Greycane attempts to lighten the mood.

\"Do you think we could entice more patrons into The Oak if we had a prettier face behind the bar?\" he wonders, eliciting an irksome look from Bram as he cleans a row of mugs. 

\"I mean, would you want to have to face that every time you walk through the door?\" Greycane continues, motioning toward the bartender. \"Then again I suppose it encourages people to drink more? A little liquid courage to bear the sight.\"

\"And put up with your shrieking lute. Let's not forget that,\" Bram quips. 

\"I thought you liked my melodious tunes?\" Greycane replies, feigning surprise.

\"Only because they shut you up for a bit,\" Bram snaps back. As the two men continue their jabs, the front door creaks slowly open, drawing everyone's attention. 

\"Quick, pour a drink for the man before he sees you…\" he begins to say to Bram before trailing off at the sight of the Royal Guard in the doorway.

\"I bear a message from the King for the Oathsworn,\" the knight says. \"His majesty summons you to the palace.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_8__a">"Gamel enters the common room, dirt smeared across his face and a fine mist of sweat on his brow. The small forge he set up around the back of the tavern has been his savior since the loss of his son. His grief seems to come in waves and you are thankful to know he has his work to help him through the heartache. He spots your group at the table and decides to pay you a visit. 

\"Greetings, Oathsworn. I have some good news. I've been making improvements to my field gear with the things we learned on our travels from Bastone in mind. I would be happy to make the same modifications to the other lad's equipment if you can help cover the cost.\""</string>
    <string name="chp13_7_8__c">Gamel thanks you again for giving him a shot at revenge after losing his boy. \"If you ever need anything, me and Betsy are always ready and willing,\" he says, raising his blacksmith hammer with a smile.</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_1__a">"A mob of irate locals has gathered at the Tavern, passing weapons and torches out as they mutter insults and curses aimed at the A'Dendri. This seems to be the rallying point for the crowd as they prepare to exact their ill-conceived vengeance upon the refugees of the Wychwood. Entering the establishment, you seek out the band's leader and are directed toward a tall, balding man with a long beard called Karlem.

\"Are you here to help us, Oathsworn?\" Kalrem says as you approach. \"Will the Heroes of Bastone stand by the people and help us expunge the A'Dendri scourge from our city, once and for all?\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_2__a">"Karlem rattles off a well-rehearsed litany of accusations, each winding its way back to the Green Streets. 

\"Have you noticed they are conveniently immune to the disease?\" he asks. \"What else are we to think? They are clearly in league with the Deepwood. We die, while they hide behind their new wall. And who are they to wall off territory in our city? No, my friends. We will not stand by, and let them take this city from us. This is for Verum, and the liberation of her people!\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_3__a">"Part of you is relieved that someone shares the same sentiments toward the A'Dendri as you now do. They have been nothing but a thorn in your side all along, and you are more than happy to lay the blame at their feet. You assist Karlem with organizing the assembled mob into strike teams, as well as formulating a plan of attack. Within a few minutes, a tide of furious Verum citizens along with your Free Company stand before the towering wooden walls surrounding the Green Streets. 

On your signal, amber torches and flaming arrows fly through the air, setting the wall ablaze as a counter attack of A'Dendri arrows rains down from the ramparts."</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_3__c">"It does not take long for the wall to burn, and eventually a huge section comes crashing to the ground, taking several Rangers with it. Without encouragement, the mob pours into the Green Streets, chopping and slicing at anything that is not human. Vines and branches, limbs and throats are hacked to bits. With all of the living bioforms blanketing this part of the city, nothing is left to chance. Everything must be destroyed. The plantfolk are shocked by the viciousness and unbridled fury of Verum's citizens. You see the rage in the eyes of every human face and the sad terror in the bearing of every A'Dendri. For a moment, you wonder if that same rage is on your face. 

As the last bushes and precious trees lie hacked and broken, the crowd cheers, urged on by Karlem. The scourge upon Verum that was the A'Dendri is now gone. With your duty done, you head back toward the center of the city as flames from the burning Green Streets reach into the evening sky."</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_4__a">"You have no time for ignorance such as this. These people are just looking for an excuse to take their pain and frustration out on someone and the A'Dendri fit the mold. You proceed to explain what you have learned so far in hopes of swaying their belief."</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_5__a">The fact that you have listened to their grievances seems to have earned you the opportunity to speak. You proceed to explain what you have learned so far in hopes of swaying their belief.</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_6__a">"You direct your words to the gathered mob, rather than Karlem, explaining how it was the A'Dendri who treated the infected when the plague was first discovered, not the Mendicants. You tell them of your journey to the Wychwood and of Guide's brave sacrifice, as well as her efforts to help find a cure. The truth is, the A'Dendri are the only reason the city has not already been overrun by the plague.

When your speech is finished, only Karlem and a few lowlifes remain. You send them running with a quick flash of your weapons."</string>
    <string name="chp13_9_7a__a">"You direct your words to the gathered mob, explaining how the A'Dendri should be lauded for their actions to help Verum, not persecuted. But each point you make is quickly countered by Karlem. His words are poison to which there seems to be no antidote. You are no stranger to cult-like groups with an influential leader. Invariably, the best course of action is to cut the head from the snake. Looking around the Tavern, you mark each man and woman wielding a weapon. You may be able to take down Karlem without too much loss of life.

    <string name="chp13_9_8__c">"Where words have failed, blades prevail. After ending Karlem and his lies, you only need to take down a few of the charging strangers before the rest realize what they are up against. Within a short time, the mob disperses and you are left only with an irksome stare from the Tavern's proprietor. \"Don't suppose you'll be helping me clean this mess up, will ya?\" he asks.

She fought to the last and it was all you could do to survive the encounter. A look at the lifeless eyes of the Stone Dogs sends a shudder down your spine. This could have been your fate had you not killed her first. 

The witch may be dead, but her vengeance is not. Bells continue to ring throughout the city, warning all to flee south. The northern half of the city has been lost, and every remaining survivor will be hurrying to cross the river, praying the fortifications on the southern bank hold."</string>

The one saving grace is you were able to rescue the refugees in the Market. They would surely have made it to safety by now."</string>
    <string name="chp13_epi_3__a">"While you fought back the infected and slayed the crazed witch, the A'Dendri took advantage of the chaos to evacuate their people southeast, across the river. But the same cannot be said for the other areas along the inner city wall. The North and West Gates were both breached, as thousands of infected flooded the inner city. Fires now rage where those neighborhoods once stood - including a pile of rubble that was once The Broken Oak."</string>
    <string name="chp13_epi_3__c">The Market was overrun as well, you can only see dust rising and more and more of the infected streaming in.</string>
    <string name="chp13_epi_4__a">While you were battling the witch, Greycane and Bram managed to evacuate everyone from The Broken Oak, and lead them to safety. Not everyone was as lucky, however. Huge towers of flame spike up into the evening sky from where the Green Streets once were. And you can hear the screams of women and children coming from the west, near the Marketplace. It too has been overrun.</string>
    <string name="chp13_epi_5__a">"With a heavy heart, you instruct everyone you see to head south. Streams of humanity pour across the great bridges spanning the Gutters. As the last group makes it across, hundreds of torches fly over the stone walls. Huge tongues of orange flames roar up from the dried up riverbed, incinerating the hundreds of infected clawing their way up the bank. The northern part of the city has been lost to the plague.

With your task complete, you take a seat on a pile of old crates north of the bridge and watch Verum burn. You could not have crossed the bridges yourself. Not with the plague coursing through your veins. There is no safety for you anywhere anymore. You have been infected."</string>
    <string name="chp14_16_1__a">Though the river no longer flows through this area, the ground is still incredibly muddy and you quickly find yourselves sunken up to your knees in the soggy earth. As you drag yourselves through this part of the ruins, the riverbed appears to be leading you toward the center of the city.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_1__c">"Rising from the land, in what is clearly the center of this former city, you find a massive temple complex. Truly an architectural marvel, the structure is built from a strange, dark stone which has silver veins running through it. If there is any place worth exploring in this city, it is certainly this.

Picking up a stone, you toss it through the open entrance of the temple and wait. Nothing stirs or makes a sound from within. Sparking your amber torches, you head into the shadows.

Along the walls inside the temple you find the silver veins running through an array of corridors, each splitting off to form a giant maze. After a few turns, you realize you may have gotten yourselves lost."</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_2__a">Every passageway is curved, making it difficult to keep track of each individual turn you make. However, you are able to retrace your steps and begin to recognize which corridors you have already passed through. After exploring several passageways you come to a central chamber and discover the curved corridors were purposely built as a series of concentric rings radiating out from this central room. It appears this chamber may hold some sort of ritual significance to the larger temple.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_3__a">Lost within the twisted walls of the temple, you grow tired. Each section you travel appears similar and every passageway is curved, making it difficult to keep track of the individual turns you make. Finally, you realize the corridors have been built in concentric rings which radiate outward, and as you work your way toward the central ring, you find a massive chamber at the heart of the temple.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_4__c">The chamber is an eight sided room, filled with eldritch architecture and carvings which are too alien for you to make sense of. Across each of the eight walls are frescoes depicting what appears to be some sort of timeline or chronological history of this place. An image you see on one of the walls sends a chill down your spine. It features a perfectly rendered image of an enormous spider, its front legs rearing up to blot out the sun behind it. Arranged before the arachnid are the carved images of figures who appear to be using large receptacles to collect a string of silk thread spun from its gaping abdomen. Other humanoid shapes bow down in reverence, clearly worshipping the arachnid.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_5__a">"This is not the first time you have encountered evidence of spiders during your travels here. Perhaps some of this beast's descendant spawn still hunt this area. Or perhaps the creature depicted on these walls still exists after all these ages."</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_6__a">The nightmares which stalk the Deepwood are regarded in many ways, but you have never heard of one that was worshiped in a temple. This creature was clearly revered by this civilization.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_7__a">The hunter, Tarik, appears to have sent you here for a reason. He may have hoped the ruined city would claim you as a victim, but something tells you that is not the case. The look in his eyes had been anxious. He wanted you to find this place, perhaps hoping you might discover the truth of this creature.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_7__c">Stepping from the temple, you find the sun beginning to dip below the horizon. Setting off at double pace, you head back to Refuge.</string>
    <string name="chp14_17_8__a">Stepping from the temple, you find the sun beginning to dip below the horizon. Setting off at double pace, you head back to Refuge.</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_10__a">Standing before your assembled companions, your gaze falls on Midge and Bram, both clearly struggling with warring emotions. Though pleased to see you alive, they are still troubled by the fact that you left them when the fires came and the infected began their assault in the city. Your actions saved hundreds, but that means nothing to those you were forced to leave behind, particularly the dead. And some of those dead were painfully close to Bram and Midge. After a few moments, Bram pours you a drink from a small cask he had saved. \"Come rest your tired bones, friends,\" he says. Midge, not quite as ready to forgive, runs off with tears streaming down his face.</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_11__a">"Standing before your assembled companions, your gaze falls on Midge and Bram. There are smiles on every face, as well as looks of respect and pride. You had come to them when the fires started and the infected began their assault, choosing them over all others. Because of your decision, everyone escaped safely to the south. Bram pours you a tall drink from a small cask he had rescued, as Midge bounds up to you and begins to show you the treasures he managed to 'save' during his escape."</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_11__c">As your companions celebrate, you think of all the souls that were doomed when you chose to defend The Broken Oak. Saving the few people here means nothing to the many you left behind, especially the dead.</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_12__a">"Sitting at the hastily assembled bar of the new Broken Oak, you are not at all surprised when the tent flaps part to make way for a member of the King's Guard. You knew your rescue would come at a price and the scroll in the guard's hand will tell you just how high that price will be.

Taking the proffered scroll, Greycane splits the seal and begins to silently read. \"Well, they're not wasting any time,\" he says. \"They're forming an army for a crusade to the Heart of Darkness. You are to travel further afield and gather the witches needed for The Keening by the second moon. They make it quite clear this is not optional,\" he says with a sideways smile. \"It looks like you are going to Thrace.\"

    <string name="chp14_1_13__a">"You are led down into The Gutters, among the still-flickering flames from the conflagration which was used to stop the plague's advance. Looking down the length of the former riverbed, you see hundreds, if not thousands, of charred corpses strewn about. Infected and unaffected alike lay where they fell, as they desperately tried to scale the south wall of the riverbank. Further down, you can see a fresh wave of the infected throwing themselves at the defenses and being pushed back by fire and waves of flaming arrows. The siege at the riverbank is by no means over, but at least its defenders seem to be holding the barricade for now. 

You then watch as the Asset pries open a large stone slab in the riverbank's wall, revealing a hidden access door. You soon learn the portal takes you through a labyrinth of dark passages and wet corridors, heavy with the smell of mold and rat droppings. After several minutes, you emerge at an open park-like area which very much looks like the great courtyards of the palace estate. Hundreds of tents and makeshift tenements have been hastily erected and the scene is bustling with men, women and children, all of whom seem to be either survivors or soldiers from north of the river. Every open bit of space is now packed with refugees. In a rare show of unity, it seems the nobility have opened their gates to the people, allowing them to camp in the gardens and courtyards of their district. The King surely has something to do with this. The nobles would never offer such charity to their neighbors of their own accord. 

The Asset finally stops beside a large tent with a sign you know all too well hanging from the top. The edges of the wooden sign are charred somewhat, but it still clearly reads, \"The Broken Oak\". A welcome sight after everything you have been through. As you turn to address the Asset, you find him already gone, having disappeared once again into the crowd. Drawing back the canvas door of the large tent, you enter the new home of The Broken Oak.

\"How can I run a tavern without ale?\" you hear Bram protest as he stands behind the salvaged plank of wood that has become the new bartop. 

\"That swill you brewed back at the old Oak could hardly be called ale, but that never stopped you before. Besides, it's that winning smile of yours people come to see,\" Greycane replies. Bram tries to scowl but is betrayed by the corners of his mouth that begin to turn up in a suppressed grin. 

Greycane winks at the barkeep and then spots you. \"Oathsworn!\" he beams as he instinctively moves to embrace you, but stops short. \"You made it south of the river? What about your infection?\" You tell him of the elixir and he relaxes, resheathing a dagger you had not noticed him draw. Only then does he embrace you. \"You're a sight for sore eyes, you know that?\" he says."</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_1__a">"You are infected. The thought goes round and round in your heads as you sit in the ruins of a burnt out building north of the river. You managed to save many lives by getting them across the bridges to the southern districts of Verum, but you could not manage to save yourselves. Hopelessness threatens to overwhelm you.

Looking down at the black spots forming on your arms, you know it is only a matter of time before the death bell tolls for you. Everywhere you look, you see what the plague can do to people. This part of the city is overflowing with infected souls and you have had to kill more than a few who drew too close. The sounds of people screaming in the distance tell you not everyone is faring so well. 

As you stare into the smoldering remains of a seamstress' shop, you hear footsteps approaching. Taking a deep breath, you draw your weapons and ready yourselves for another attack by the infected. However, standing atop some old timbers, you find the Asset who journeyed with you to the Wychwood. As he stands alone, you find it difficult to focus your gaze upon him, as though your eyes refuse to obey. 

You force yourself to make eye contact and ask him if he has come to finish the job the plague started. With a tilt of his head, the Asset smiles. \"If I had, you would already be dead,\" he replies softly. \"Besides, you are not allowed to die yet.\" 

The man produces a curative jar from inside his dark cloak and passes it to you. It appears to be some kind of green elixir. He then hands you a sealed note. As you break the black wax seal, the Asset carefully watches you, waiting like a coiled snake, ready to strike. 

The note reads: \"Heroes of Verum, Heroes of Bastone. We know you have become afflicted. The Elixir will slow your demise and prevent you from spreading it to others. Do not squander it. It has been made from a substance which was taken from the Wychwood and no more can be produced. Imbibe the contents equally amongst yourselves and return to the line. You are needed.\" 

There is no signature on the note, only the mark of the Raven. You know all too well, this is from the Watchers. With nothing to lose, you each take a dose of the green elixir."</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_2__a">Looking at your arms, you see the black spots begin to fade, though they do not disappear completely. Still, you can feel the roots of the infection coiling around your insides. For the moment, you do not need to worry about dying. At least not today.</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_3__a">Looking at your arms, you see the black spots begin to fade, though they do not disappear completely. Still, you can still feel the roots of the infection coiling around your insides. For the moment, you do not need to worry about dying. At least not today.</string>

    <string name="chp14_1_5__a">"The Asset bids you to follow him down a nearby street where you find a dozen infected corpses. These people were clearly slain by blades, though not by you. Carefully considering the Asset, your suspicions of his lethality are written plainly in the blood pooling at your feet. 

The shadowy man proceeds to lead you south between crumbling buildings and smoke-filled alleys. Slipping down one narrow street, a flaming building collapses before you in a heap of timber and debris."</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_5__c">Working your way through the charred remains, you carefully avoid several still-burning sections of rubble, patting out flames that scorch your clothing, and finally reaching the far side of the avenue. You find the Asset already waiting for you several feet ahead, unharmed and leaning against a wall. You swear there is a look of amusement on his face as he turns and continues down the alley.</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_9__a">"You wake early the next day and begin preparations for the journey ahead. Thrace is commonly known as 'The City of Masks', but you are more acquainted with its other name, 'The City of Slaves'. You will want to be well-prepared for whatever you may encounter there."</string>
    <string name="chp14_1_9__c">"Hours later, you find yourselves back on the Wire Road, trudging beneath the cursed canopy of the Deepwood with the hopes of a city once again on your shoulders. You wonder how you got into this mess. It's a nasty job but someone has to do it and it just became very personal for you. Without a witch, The Keening will not be possible and you won't be finding a cure for the plague now worming its way through your body. The city will die and you along with it.

The thought gives you purpose and drives you on through the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp14_25_1__a">Moving through the cursed woods, you finally discover signs of civilization. Half-buried in the earth and covered by moss and rotten roots are the remnants of an old stone wall. Following along, you find more ruins and a dried up riverbed which snakes its way down from the mountains to the east. Whatever this place once was, the area it covers is vast.</string>
    <string name="chp14_26_1__c">"As you travel deeper into the ruins, it becomes clear this was an ancient city at one time. You can easily pick out the hollowed husks of destroyed buildings and other structures dominating the landscape. The Deepwood is choked with the remains of old, forgotten cities, but the ruins here feel older than any you have ever encountered before. 

Looking east, you see a maze of endless buildings and to the south there is an old, dried up riverbed which runs through the city there. The landscape to the south seems like it may be harder to traverse and will take more time to navigate. However, the view to the east is heavily obstructed by ruins and offers poor visibility."</string>
    <string name="chp14_27_1__a">Pressing through the ruins, the ground starts to incline slightly and you realize you are now traveling into the foothills of the eastern mountain range. The ancient dwellings here are arranged more densely and the impression of old streets and long-forgotten walkways creates a natural path to follow. You find traveling through this part of the ruined city easy and it allows you to save some time.</string>
    <string name="chp14_27_2__a">Your foot suddenly catches on a tripwire! You manage to dodge away and, thankfully, the trap never engages. Tracing the wire back, you find a lethal spike trap hidden beneath a crop of rocks and disarm it. It seems someone does not want people snooping around here.</string>
    <string name="chp14_27_3__a">Your foot snags on a tripwire! Before you can dodge away, a spike trap bursts from a cropping of rock, swinging down into your Free Company.</string>
    <string name="chp14_27_3__c">You quickly bandage the wound to stop the bleeding and hope the spikes were not poisoned. It seems someone does not want people snooping around here.</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_10__a">"Running off into the Deepwood without a bearing is suicide. You would become lost in a matter of moments and never find your way out. As you frantically search for another escape route, you catch sight of tiny lights off in the distance. Looking closely, you see small jars filled with glowflies hanging from the trees, dozens of them, forming a crude pathway that winds off into the darkness. The glowflies would not last long in those jars, which means someone is maintaining them. It clearly leads somewhere, and considering what you have chasing you, anywhere is better than here. 

Keeping one hand on your blade, you release the Wire and follow the lights."</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_11__a">"You know it is madness to travel through the Deepwood without the Wire Road, but you have no choice at the moment. To stay here would mean certain death. Letting go of the Wire, you sprint into uncharted territory, the Wire Road quickly disappearing behind you. Thankfully, the buzzing fades with it. 

As you continue on, an eerie quiet envelopes you. It is as though the Deepwood senses your every step. You pass tree after tree with only your compass to give you a sense of direction. You are certain you are heading east, but traveling across such a great distance, the smallest deviation from your charted path could cause you to pass Thrace without ever knowing. As the seeds of doubt grow in your mind, you begin to wonder if you made the right choice when you suddenly spot tiny lights off in the distance. 

Looking closely, you see there are small jars filled with glowflies hanging from the trees, dozens of them, forming a crude pathway that winds off into the darkness. The glowflies would not last long in those jars, which means someone is maintaining them. Perhaps the trees lead back to the Wire. 

Keeping one hand on your blade, you head toward the lights."</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_12__a">"Following the trail of jar-like lanterns through the trees, you eventually come to a wide clearing, seemingly untouched by the Deepwood. In its center is a small village. Strangely, the settlement has no palisade walls protecting it and you cannot imagine how anyone could survive out here without at least that one, crucial aspect of protection. Turning your focus back to the untainted ground, you try to make sense of how the Deepwood's touch could possibly have been kept at bay here. Suddenly, a woman steps into view and approaches.

\"Greetings, travelers. My name is Nydia,\" she says, introducing herself. \"I am the village elder here, as well as an herbalist for my sins. Welcome to our refuge.\" She considers you with a warm smile, pulling back her cowl to reveal a long mane of red hair, streaked with ribbons of silver. Her soft, golden eyes watch your every move.

After explaining your situation, she nods gracefully and invites you to stay. \"I am afraid we do not have much, but we are happy to help in any way we can. If you are not in a hurry, we will gather some supplies and help you find your way back to the Wire Road.\"

Though you would prefer not to delay your mission further by resting here, the truth remains you would have died if not for this village. You ultimately agree to accept the offer and are provided a small hut for the night, as well as some hot soup from the kindly woman. Staying in a village unprotected by walls makes it all but impossible to relax, let alone sleep. Instead, you grip your weapon tight and wait for the coming dawn."</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_1__a">"Your journey takes you to the lands east of Verum, along the only stretch of the Wire Road leading to Thrace. Before your departure, Greycane felt it necessary to 'educate' your group on the peculiarities of Thrace so as not to, as he called it, \"Cause an incident.\" He was very clear to convey that while Thrace is a vassal state under Verum's law, it is the Five dynastic families who hold all power there. \"The hardest reality to accept will be the slavery,\" he had said. \"Tread lightly when you encounter it. You may see people being abused, but to the Five, slaves are merely property. Do not intervene in their business unless you are looking for a fight.\"

The journey passes with relative ease, but as dusk falls on the seventh day, you hear a sound no Free Company wants to hear - a distant buzzing growing louder as it draws near. Quickly taking cover behind rocks and trees, you brace yourselves as a swarm of Burrowers, insects the size of your thumb, zip past. Most of the swarm passes by without issue, but a small contingent senses your presence and dives for your eyes, nose and mouth, seeking a way in."</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_4__c">Striking a torch, you wave the flames wildly in front of your own face. The fire singes your skin, but manages to force the biting insects into a retreat with burnt wings. After a few moments, the buzzing rises once again and you realize the threat is not over yet.</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_5__a">Striking a torch, you wave the flames wildly in front of your own face.

After a few moments, the buzzing rises once again and you realize the threat is not over yet.</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_6__a">"The buzzing quickly grows louder as the bulk of the swarm wheels around and focuses their full attention on you. Burrowers will strip a man to the bone in minutes or burrow deep into your flesh and lay their eggs in their thousands. It's a bad way to go. You need to come up with a plan quickly if you wish to live. There is no way to outrun these insects, but you may be able to distract them. 

Burrowers only seek flesh to lay their eggs in and food to consume. Since you are not about to give them your flesh, your rations are your only option. There is no telling how much food would be needed to distract a swarm that size and so you dump everything. You might die of starvation, but if this distraction fails, you will not live long enough to find out. After spreading all of your rations across the ground, you immediately run off along the Wire."</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_7__c">Drawing deeply on your reserves, you charge along the Wire Road at full pelt, trying to put distance between you and the swarm. The fact that you are not dead yet tells you your distraction must be working.</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_8__a">You charge along the Wire Road at full pelt, trying to put distance between you and the swarm. The fact that you are not dead yet tells you your distraction must be working.</string>
    <string name="chp14_2_9__a">"Your lungs burn from sprinting. It feels like you have been running all night, but the thought of an excruciating death propels you on. With one hand on your blade and the other on the Wire Road, you bound over a fat root, duck around a Deepwood tree and suddenly stop. The Wire Road is gone. 

Sections of the Wire Road commonly break or become severed by the ever-shifting woods. Teams of Wire Runners are always busy following the cables and maintaining these life lines. For whatever reason, this section has not been repaired for some time. The Wire to Thrace ends here. 

The buzzing drone of the swarm grows louder behind you once again. Though they are quite a ways off at the moment, it will not be long before they catch up to you. Every fiber in your being is urging you to run - now.

    <string name="chp14_32_1__c">Pushing through a thick tangle of vines, you come upon a ruined village.

    <string name="chp14_32_2__a">"You spend some time turning over stones and looting long decomposed corpses, but only uncover a few minor items of value. And as the sun dips lower in the sky, you are forced to accept that you probably will not find anything to guide you back to the Wire Road or Thrace today. 

On your way out of the village, your eye catches the glint of iron in the distance and, upon investigation, you find several corpses with large puncture wounds in their chests. Their attire is unmistakably Scar Tribe and looks to be of the same group you encountered in the tree top village. They must have a hunting ground in the area. The tribe may have been responsible for the death of the village, but the remains are far too decayed for you to determine what transpired here. With your search complete, you begin the trek back to Refuge, respooling the silver line as you retrace your steps through the woods."</string>

    <string name="chp14_35_2__a">Studying the terrain, you learn that something huge passed through here. Several trees list to either side, nearly toppled over with broken limbs strewn about. Interestingly, you also notice several deep holes in the dirt, somewhat like those one would dig for a fence post.</string>

    <string name="chp14_42_2__a">You find several toppled trees and broken limbs surrounding the area where the two creatures were eaten. Whatever killed them must have been huge. There are indeed blood-sucking creatures in the Deepwood, but you have never known any as big as this.</string>

Slowly backing away, you tread very lightly. If anyone triggers them, you will all suffer."</string>

Deer are a rare sight in the Deepwood, with most surviving in nomadic packs. This unlucky one appears to have been traveling alone. But what is truly peculiar about the animal, is it has been drained of its innards through a large hole in its chest. 

The tracks end here, with nothing more than a dried up waterway stretching further into the mountains. There does not appear to be any reason to continue the search here.."</string>

Moving quickly and quietly through the shadows, you make your way down a pitch black alley to her hut. The home is shrouded in complete darkness, not a single amber flame burning.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_14__a">Examining the exterior walls of the building you see they are smooth and offer little to grab on to.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_16__a">"While searching the building's exterior, you suddenly smell the rotten stench of death and decay. It is definitely coming from within the structure."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_16__c">"Before you can move to investigate further, a voice calls to you, \"Up late, Oathsworn?\"

Turning, you see Nydia standing in the darkness with a smile on her face. \"That is a shrine where offerings to The One are laid,\" she says, motioning to the tall building. \"It stood here long before my arrival to the village. It's the reason we have been protected all these years.\" 

You have encountered many strange beliefs in your travels to the various villages littering the Deepwood, but none quite like this. Your attempts to understand more about their faith go unanswered as Nydia bids you farewell for the night.

\"You must get your rest, Oathsworn. You have a long day ahead of you.\" Though she has done little to assuage your suspicions, she is right about needing your rest. Trying to find the Wire Road on no sleep all but ensures failure. As Nydia fades into the night, you head back to your hut for some much needed rest."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_17__a">"While searching the building's exterior, a voice calls to you, \"Up late, Oathsworn?\"

Turning, you see Nydia, her hand gripping a shawl against the cold. \"That is a shrine where offerings to The One are laid,\" she says, motioning to the tall building. \"It stood here long before my arrival to the village. It's the reason we have been protected all these years.\" 

You have encountered many strange beliefs in your travels to countless villages littering the Deepwood, but none quite like this. Your attempts to understand more about their faith go unanswered as Nydia bids you farewell for the night.

\"You must get your rest, Oathsworn. You have a long and exhausting day ahead of you.\" Though she has done little to assuage your suspicions, she is right about needing your rest. Trying to find the Wire Road on no sleep all but ensures failure. As Nydia fades into the night, you head back to your hut for some much needed rest."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_18__a">"Hidden in the grass at the very edge of the clearing, you find a row of heavy stakes driven into the ground. Each one features a thick iron ring on top, some with lengths of chain still attached. On one, you find a piece of dried up meat. 

The villagers appear to be using it as some kind of bait. But is it to lure beasts closer to the village or to ward them off? After a search for anything else out of the ordinary, you head back to your hut for some much needed rest, pondering your new discovery."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_19__a">You circle the village for some time, but are unable to find anything out of the ordinary. As fatigue begins to set in, you give up the search, and head to your bunks for some much needed rest.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_1__a">"When morning comes, you are invited to join the rest of the village for breakfast. Daylight allows you to take your first clear look at the settlement which predominantly consists of ramshackle huts arranged around a wide commons with a tall building in its center. Amazingly, the ground here does not consist of the usual chaotic mess of green mud and cursed Deepwood roots, but rather plush green grass. You cannot recall ever seeing anything like it. Every village and settlement is forced to hack away the invading flora on a daily basis or salt the earth to keep the Deepwood's touch at bay. But somehow this area remains pristine.

While sharing a meal of light stew and soft breads, you ask Nydia how they have managed to cultivate such wonderful grass without it being corrupted by the woods. \"The One protects us,\" she replies with her signature warm smile. You notice other villagers look to you with a similar countenance to Nydia as she speaks. \"We are delighted to have you here with us, travelers.\"

After breakfast, you steer the conversation toward the issue of getting back to the Wire Road. You learn they have been unable to find the Wire to Thrace for some time. Only the way back to Verum is known. \"Unfortunately, there are no maps of the area,\" Nydia tells you. \"We set the lanterns in the trees to help those who become lost. Some choose to stay. Others move on. There is another village to the west of here, whom we trade with on occasion. Perhaps they may have a map to help you get back on the road?\" 

Nydia hands you a spool of thin, silver line. \"Take this. Use it to trace your way. If you become lost again, you can follow it back here. There is enough thread for at least a day's journey.\""</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_20__a">"You quietly slip into the house unnoticed and briefly look around, finding nothing at first. Then suddenly, a young woman with long, flowing hair, similar to Nydia's, steps into view. Before you have a chance to speak, she raises a finger to her lips, silencing you. 

\"I'm Clydia,\" she whispers. \"She keeps me locked up when strangers are here. You must leave. Please. She will eat you! Hurry!\"

The young woman is clearly panicked. You begin to ask her \"Who?\" but before she can answer, Nydia's voice echoes from a room upstairs. \"Can't you sleep, darling?\" 

As the frightened young woman rushes up the stairs, you use the distraction to slip out of the house. Being caught inside the elder's house after dark could jeopardize your chances of receiving any more rations from the village."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_20__c">"You are convinced that Nydia holds some kind of control over the village and its people, but you still have not uncovered enough information to act on it. You are very much at the mercy of this village's charity and to lose that would mean an almost certain death wandering the Deepwood. Returning to your hut, you spend an uneasy night with one eye open, and a hand on your weapon."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_21__a">"The moment you slip into Nydia's home, you hear her voice call from upstairs, \"Can't you sleep, darling?\" 

The stairs creak as footsteps begin their descent. Being caught inside the elder's house after dark could jeopardize your chances of receiving any more rations from the village and so you quickly flee the scene. Once outside, you hide close against the wall of the house and wait for Nydia to return to bed so you can make another attempt to investigate. After some time, you realize you have missed your chance and head back to your hut, hoping to rest for what little remains of the night."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_2__a">You explain how you were able to find the village, but it had been destroyed and seemed to have been abandoned for several months. Nydia is shocked and saddened by the news, telling you how she considered them to be good people. You ask her how long it has been since anyone traded with them. \"Not for several months now,\" she replies, before walking off to speak with some of the other villagers.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_30__a">"Time Triggered Story

You return to the village just before nightfall."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_30__c">Nydia is already waiting for you the moment you step from the woods into the clearing. \"Did you find the Wire Road?\" she inquires. \"Or the village at least?\"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_31__a">"With the sun now set, you decide this may be a good opportunity to speak with a few other villagers or explore the settlement a bit more before bedding down for the evening.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_32__a">"There is clearly something going on in this village that people are trying to hide from you. Making your way back to your hut, you consider whether it would be prudent to spend the night investigating or to try to get a good night's sleep and regain your strength.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_33__a">You are blessed with an uninterrupted night of sleep and awake the next morning refreshed and ready for the arduous day ahead.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_34__a">"Using the cover of darkness, you identify a few areas of interest to investigate further.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_35__a">"Your second day in the strange village called Refuge begins with gathering your gear and heading to the commons. The place is bustling with activity as the villagers seem to be preparing for some kind of festival. You recall a few mentions of a feast from your conversations so far. The life of a Deepwood settler is rather bleak. Many settlements hold periodic celebrations as a way to keep the creeping darkness from consuming people's minds and eroding morale. Apparently, one such occasion is coming up, as you see them hanging bunting and erecting a maypole for the children to dance around.

Of course, in the middle of all the activity you find Nydia, busy organizing and offering directions. 

\"Good Morning,\" she smiles as you approach. \"I hope you slept well. You've joined us at a great time here at Refuge. We are holding a feast the night after next to celebrate The One's protection over us all. We have so much to be thankful for. Speaking of which, I asked Sarah to prepare something special for you today, to lift your spirits.\" 

Nydia pulls a small cloth covered jar from a crate and hands it to you. \"She makes the most wonderful garlic mushrooms, I made sure to save you some. I'm afraid that is all I can offer you in the way of rations.\" 

Her scant offering of rations will not support your Company for very long and you consider asserting your authority as Oathsworn by demanding she provide more food. However, looking at the gaunt faces and undernourished bodies of the villagers, you realize they already live on less than what they need. They may be preparing for a feast, but such celebrations in the Deepwood are often meager affairs and provide more sustenance to the soul than the body.

Accepting the gift, you thank her for the kindness."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_36__a">"\"I'm glad we were able to speak early this morning,\" Nydia continues. \"I remembered something which may be of some help to you. Not long ago, we had a caravan pass through trading iron and other wares. They were the ones who told us about the Wire being lost. Ultimately, the merchants decided to brave the Deepwood, rather than stay with us. They left with a supply of food, amber and silk, heading north, but I do not believe they managed to travel far. We heard screams in the distance that night and a great commotion not long after. Perhaps if you were to track down the remnants of their caravan, you would find rations for your travels, maybe even the Wire Road itself?

With an entire day at your disposal, you consider your options. Would it be best to search for the lost caravan to the north and possibly solve your ration problems? Or should you choose a different direction to focus your search?"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_37__a">"\"I'm relieved you were able to find the lost caravan yesterday,\" she continues. \"At least the mystery can be put to rest. The merchants were the ones who told us about the Wire being lost. Ultimately, they decided to brave the Deepwood, rather than stay with us. They left with a supply of food, amber and silk, heading north, but never made it very far. We heard screams in the distance that night and a great commotion not long after. Perhaps you could try finding our neighbors to the west today? They will be able to offer more assistance than we can.\"

With an entire day at your disposal, you consider your options. Would it be best to find the village to the west and possibly obtain a map of the area? Or should you choose a different direction to focus your search in?"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_3__a">"You mention the ruins you discovered and what you found there. Nydia shakes her head dismissively, \"I've not seen them though some of the hunters have mentioned finding ruins. I've no time for dead cities, I am afraid. I must focus on the living. Speaking of which, come inside and rest. There is food on the fire for you and a warm bed waiting.\""</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_40__a">"Time Triggered Story

You arrive back at Refuge as the sun slips beneath the horizon."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_40__c">Nydia is already waiting for you at the edge of the strange clearing of greenery. \"Did you find what you were looking for, Oathsworn?\" she asks hopefully.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_41__a">"With twilight settling over the village, the people hustle about in one last burst of activity before the final rays of daylight are lost.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_42__a">"Back at your hut, you cannot escape the nagging feeling that there is something strange beneath the surface of this village. The people here seem 'off' somehow. Suddenly, a thought strikes you. While observing the preparations for the festivities earlier in the day, you noticed how the only person smiling was Nydia. The events of the day have left your body yearning for sleep, but your suspicions tell you to investigate the village. You need the rest, but ignoring your instincts could prove dangerous.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_43__a">Sleep takes you before you can find the strength to head back out into the village. Perhaps you were more exhausted than you thought.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_44__a">"While hiding in the shadows, you debate where to focus your investigation.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_45__a">"On the morning of your third day, you are woken at dawn by the sound of villagers busy at work. Stepping from your hut, you see preparations for the upcoming feast are nearly complete. They must have begun the work hours before sunrise to be this far along in the effort. Almost immediately, Nydia approaches. \"Good morning to you, Oathsworn,\" she says, offering you an armful of provisions. \"Please, take this for your journey ahead. And if you don't find your way back to the Wire Road today, remember you are welcome to join us for this evening's feast.\""</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_46__a">"As Nydia begins to turn away, she pauses. \"I have not mentioned this yet due to the danger, but there is another route which may lead you back to the Wire Road. To the east, there is an old trader's route which cuts through the mountains. The Wire Road passes around that area, so you may be able to reacquire it on the other side. I've never ventured that way myself, so I can't be of more help. Good luck to you, friends. Your presence here has been uplifting for our people. We had been hopeful you would join us for the feast this evening, but understand you have a mission you must complete.\" With her signature smile, she turns and departs.

Not wanting to burn daylight, you deliberate on which direction to take today. Should you follow the route Nydia has suggested or attempt a different route?"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_47__a">"\"I'm afraid I don't have any other ideas to help you with your journey. I was going to suggest the old trading route through the mountains to the east, but it seems you've already found that way impassable. Good luck to you, friends. Your presence here has been uplifting for our people. We had been hopeful you would join us for the feast this evening, but understand you have a mission you must complete.\" With her signature smile, she turns and departs. 

Not wanting to burn daylight, you deliberate on which direction to take today. Should you search one of the places Nydia has mentioned before or attempt a different route?"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_4__a">"Settling on a direct approach, you ask Nydia if she knows anything about the caravan you found in the Deepwood. \"All dead?\" she asks. You nod. \"I suspected as much. They left us after the Wire was lost. As you know, the woods here are treacherous. I do hope the next caravan will make it through. After all, we are still dependent on outside trade here.\" 

You explain how the caravan did not appear to have been attacked by beasts of the wild, but rather by men with weapons. \"Our friends in the nearby village have been assaulted by a Scar Tribe in the past,\" she says. \"Perhaps they returned?\"

When asked if a Scar Tribe has ever attacked Refuge, Nydia shakes her head. \"No. The One protects\" she smiles."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_50__a">Time Triggered Story</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_50__c">"Exhausted and frustrated, you return to Refuge only to find that Nydia is not waiting at the edge of the clearing to greet you as she was each of the prior days. The sound of flutes and drums playing lively music tell you why. The feast is already in full swing. You find the villagers dancing around a maypole and talking together in the commons. Plates of bread and meat adorn the tables and even an assortment of fruity treats for dessert. 

\"Ah! The guests of honor have arrived!\" Nydia calls out. \"Now the feast can truly begin!\" She beckons you over to a central table, prepared just for you. It seems out of place to be held in such esteem, but the villagers are overjoyed by your presence and the food does smell delicious. Still, you are in no mood to celebrate, and it takes a bit of coaxing from Nydia for you to agree to join the feast.

Once everyone has taken their seats, Nydia leads the assembly in prayer. \"Let us give thanks to The One, who protects us and gives us peace. May she ever watch over us. As we feast, so will she. As our joy rises, may all those gathered here make merry, for we are the chosen and this place is our refuge. Now and Always.\" 

\"Now and Always,\" the villagers reply to the liturgy. 

As the music begins again, Nydia pours some wine. \"Our best for the guests of honor,\" she says, smiling as she offers each of you a cup."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_51__c">"You suspect the drink has been laced and decide the time has come to confront Nydia. She has been hiding the truth and guiding you down false paths ever since your arrival, to keep you trapped in this village. Every interaction has deepened your suspicions toward a darker deception lurking beneath the surface here, and you will no longer play her game. Slapping the cup from Nydia's hand, you rise.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_52__a">"After all you have been through these last few weeks, you could stand to relax a moment. You can't go anywhere tonight and Thrace will still be out there somewhere in the morning. The wine has a rich, red color and sweet aroma. Taking a draft from the cup, you watch as a group of girls dance around the maypole, each holding a colored taper attached to the pole. They weave in and out of each other as they skip about, creating a mesmerizing pattern. The ballet of colors and blurring shapes slowly relaxes you, and for the briefest moment, you forget your troubles. In that moment, Nydia approaches you with the same false smile she always wears. The world begins to spin and you realize too late what has happened. Desperately trying to cling to consciousness, all thought slips from your grasp."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_53__a">There is no need for words. Her transgressions against you are more than enough to warrant her death. Quickly drawing your weapons, you strike Nydia down before she has a chance to react. The music immediately stops as a hundred faces turn toward you.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_53__c">"\"You've… killed her…\" the hunter, Tarik, says with a look of shock. Beside him, you see a group of men armed with crude weapons also looking on in bewilderment. They must have been the backup plan if the laced drink had not done the trick. However, with Nydia dead, they do not seem eager to confront you. 

As one, they throw down their weapons and beg for clemency. \"Mercy lords! We were only obeying her orders!\" cries one of them. \"Any who spoke against her were fed to…\" says another, his words trailing off. 

\"But she's already coming!\" Tarik says, panic written across his face. \"The Wandering Queen\". You were to be her sacrifice. To ensure the protection of our village for another season. Now nothing will stop her!\"

As if summoned by their words, you hear skittering coming from the Deepwood. Rushing to the edge of the village, you peer into the darkness, waiting for the encroaching monsters. Then you hear the heavy, hastened thud of dozens of approaching legs."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_54__a">"You quickly draw your weapons and surround Nydia, cutting off her escape. As you level your accusations, Nydia interrupts with laughter, \"It's too late! She has already been summoned. She is coming for you! We need only offer you up.\" 

Nydia nods to someone and you suddenly hear the sound of a dozen weapons being drawn. Turning, you find a group of men armed with cudgels and pitchforks. They are clearly the backup plan in case the laced drink had not done the trick. As one, they charge."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_54__c">The initial rush manages to drive you back toward the edge of the village. There is a ferocity in their eyes that seems to be driven by fear, rather than hate. Ultimately, they are no match for your skill and power, but as you gain the upper hand, they cease their assault and begin to back away with terrified looks on their faces. Turning, you see the Deepwood trees swaying in the night air accompanied by the heavy, hastened thud of dozens of approaching legs.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_55__a">"The spiders surround you, gushing from the tree tops and clawing their way across the root-tangled ground. Somehow, you will need to find an advantage if you plan to get out of this alive. 

On a hunch, you grab one of the amber torches encircling the sacrificial area. Testing your theory, you set fire to the sticky webbing that coats the nearest tree and watch as fire spreads rapidly up the trunk. The flames quickly engulf the tree, felling every spider lurking in its boughs. Your victory is short lived however, as you turn to face the Queen spider and find she has disappeared. Spiders are ambush predators and she has slipped into the treetops in order to wait for the perfect moment to strike. You can feel her giant, midnight black eyes watching you as her young descend from the trees."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_56__a">"The clank of iron returns you to consciousness and you open your eyes to a night lit by amber torches. Iron manacles bind your arms and legs tightly as you find yourselves staked to the ground beyond the edge of Refuge. Instinctively, you test the chains, shaking them violently. They are firmly in place but…

\"I would not struggle, Oathsworn. It will only hasten her arrival,'' Nydia's voice quips from beyond your vision. \"Know your death will not be in vain. You will fulfill your Oath in the end. As the Queen feasts upon you, our village will earn her protection for another year.\"

You have been deceived. For three days, Nydia had been feeding you lies about how to find the Wire Road, to keep you here. Her goal all along was to offer you up as a sacrifice. 

Looking around, you see your weapons collected in a pile not far away. If only you could reach them. Suddenly, you hear the heavy thud of dozens of approaching legs. Rushing down from the trees, you see dozens of fat, eight-legged spiders crawling toward you. They weave webs that coat every surface they touch, leaving a blanket of silk in their wake which stretches far into the Deepwood. It is as though they are preparing a royal procession for… a Queen! 

Massive, spear-like black legs flicker into view high in the trees as the light of the amber torches reflect off a multitude of horrid eyes and a bulbous torso of egg sacks and black chitin. The giant creature draws slowly closer, as if savoring the meal to come. Looking into its fixated black orbs, you see intelligence and a voracious hunger. The people of Refuge had made a pact with that? You must free yourselves, and quickly.

The people of Refuge had made a pact with that? 

You form a defensive ring as the first hound-sized web weavers approach, your weapons cleaving and slicing furry abdomens and spiky legs. They are not easy to kill and for each one slain, more are quick to descend from the trees beyond. Somehow, you will need to find an advantage if you hope to get out of this alive. 

A short distance away, you see a circle of amber torches surrounding a bunch of wooden stakes fixed with manacles driven into the ground. Clearly the plan was to shackle you there and offer you as a sacrifice to the horde of spiders. On a hunch, you rush to the circle and grab one of the amber torches. Testing your theory, you set fire to the sticky webbing that coats the nearest tree and watch as fire spreads rapidly up the trunk.

    <string name="chp14_55_5__a">"You immediately describe to Nydia the sight you witnessed at the mountain passage. \"Spiders.\" she considers. \"Yes, that makes sense. That must be the silk we have been gathering from the trees for use as recovery lines. Like the spool of thread I gave you. I knew it must have come from somewhere.\" 

When you ask her if the spiders have ever attacked Refuge, she replies with a shake of her head, \"No. The One has always protected us.\" 

Later that night, you try your best to get some sleep, but your hand never leaves your weapon. Nydia's faith in the One may help ease her fears, but you know all too well the danger that lurks in the Deepwood and if it decides to come here, there is not much to stop it."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_60__a">"Shaking your head, she moves to console you. \"Tomorrow is another day, friends. Come now, get some rest. I'm sure you'll fare better tomorrow.\""</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_61__a">She tries to offer encouraging words after you speak of your inability to gain any useful information, but you are in no mood for empty sentiments. If you do not find the Wire soon, your mission could be in jeopardy. Besides, you have no desire to live out the rest of your days in this strange isolated village.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_62__a">"You noticed there was something odd in the words the girl used to answer your question. She said 'I miss' not 'I will miss'. How could the girl have known the village was destroyed if Nydia supposedly had no idea? Why would Nydia have sent you there if she knew it had been destroyed?"</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_62__c">You file away the information and notice that the night is drawing in.</string>

As the skittering horde approaches, you reach for the power deep inside with your mind, focusing on the stakes that secure you to the ground. As the first spider touches your leg, you unleash a shrieking scream, blasting the arachnid away in a wave of telekinetic force and shattering your manacles. Rolling to one side, you quickly free your companions. There is no chance of survival without them. Not wasting a moment, everyone scrabbles for their weapons, forming a defensive ring as the horde of spiders descends from the trees.

As the skittering horde approaches, you send spores into the roots near you, forcing them up to stab a spider which has crawled on top of you, piercing its thorax. More roots burst forth from the soil, wrapping themselves around your manacles to crush them like dried leaves. Free of your bonds, you roll to one side and summon more roots to free your companions.

As the skittering horde approaches, you let out a sharp whistle, sending one of your great falcons diving toward a spider which has crawled on top of you. Its talons bite deep into the creature's hard carapace before flapping its mighty wings and hauling it high into the air. At the same moment, your second falcon attacks your manacles, freeing you. One by one, you release your companions from their bonds and immediately collect your weapons. There may be no escape, but at least you will face the enemy with a weapon in your hand. As your Free Company forms a defensive ring and prepares for the coming horde, an arachnid corpse slams into the ground at high speed and explodes, the falcons screeching their battlecries from high above."</string>

It rears in pain, retreating up a tree and offering you a chance to unlock your remaining restraints. Once on your feet, you move to release your companions and immediately dive for your weapons piled nearby. There may be no escape, but at least you will face the enemy with a weapon in your hand."</string>

As your prey comes to you, the corner of your jaw rises into a bestial grin. You will carve many notches into your battle gear once this battle is done, you may even need a new plate of armor to record them all. Pounding at your restraints, they easily break apart. Such feeble iron was not made to hold an Ursus. With a free arm, you reach up and grasp a spider that has crawled on top of you, crushing its face in your mighty grip. After freeing yourself of the remaining manacles, you hurry to snap the restraints of your companions. A wave of arachnids descends on the area as you roar a beastial challenge, summoning them all to you. While you wade into them and toss them aside, your companions move to retrieve their weapons and ready themselves to join you in the fray. This is going to be glorious."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_69__a">You are groggy, but the terrifying situation you now find yourself in has a remarkably sobering effect. As the skittering horde approaches, you frantically yank at the iron chains, again and again, until one arm slips free. You slam your freed fist into the face of a spider that has crawled on top of you, sending it recoiling and buying you precious moments to free your other limbs. Rolling to the side, you come to the aid of the companion beside you and work together to free the others. Not wasting any time, everyone scrabbles for their weapons, forming a defensive ring as the horde of spiders descends from the trees. There may be no escape, but at least you will face the enemy with a weapon in your hand.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_6__c">The village feels quite peaceful in the waning light of day. Most of the villagers have retired to their huts for the evening and you see the warmth of amber fires through their small windows. Everything about this settlement seems to defy the realities of the Deepwood. Somehow its corrupting touch has completely overlooked this place. But most incredible of all, is how it has managed to survive what appears to be a very long time without the protection of palisade walls. You have heard rumors there were some areas of the Deepwood where monster encounters are rare. But your practical experience has always forced you to dismiss such claims. Perhaps The One truly does watch over and protect this place.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_71__a">After a bit of encouragement, she finally gives you a small sackful.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_72__a">Despite your best efforts, she refuses to provide any, telling you the mushroom stocks are carefully protected in the village and you will need to speak with Nydia if you want more. You know Nydia will most likely refuse you as well, and decide to drop the matter.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_73__a">"You change the conversation to the ruined village you came across and ask the cultivator if she can tell you anything more about it. \"Sad, isn't it?\" she says, her innocent eyes reflecting on the loss. \"I miss trading mushroom spores with old Nora over there…\" the girl continues as Nydia joins the conversation.

\"Sarah? Will the new harvest be ready for the feast?\" Nydia asks. 

\"Yes, mistress,\" she replies. 

Turning to you, Nydia begs your leave. \"Sorry Oathsworn, may I steal her from you? We need to discuss the recipe for the big day.\" Together they return to the mushroom patch."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_7__c">"Most villages found on the outer edges of civilization tend to have very limited food choices, with roots and watery soups being the standard. And so any time a carcass of wild game is dragged back to town there tends to be quite a celebration. Hunters usually hold positions of high regard in many settlements, assuming they survive their duties long enough to enjoy it. They are also uniquely positioned to possess the kind of information a Free Company may be looking for.

You find one of the village hunters on his way back from the Green and stop him to ask a few questions, specifically if he may have found any sign of the Wire Road. \"No such luck, friends,\" he says, shaking his head. \"We searched for it, but only came across the one to Verum.\" Glancing around, he waves you behind one of the huts, \"I don't know where the Wire is, but there are some old ruins just south of Refuge you may want to investigate.\" The hunter suddenly freezes, listening closely to the night air. \"Watch your backs here, Oathsworn,\" he warns as he turns and leaves."</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_8__c">You find one of the cultivators tending to a patch of mushrooms outside one of the huts. As she bundles a few into a small handkerchief, you immediately recognize the mushrooms to be the ones found in the rations which Nydia has been giving you. Approaching the woman, you ask if it would be possible to have a few more.</string>
    <string name="chp14_55_9__a">"As you wander the village, most of the people you encounter appear somewhat off and apprehensive. It is almost as if they are trying to avoid you. Perhaps they are afraid? The entirety of the village sits within a perfect circle of untainted land. Each home is of simple construction with tiny, paned windows in every one, except for the strange building in the very center of the town.

Looking toward Nydia's home, you suddenly see the face of a young woman peeking out at you. You are fairly certain you have not seen the woman before. However, before you can get a proper look, she draws the curtains shut."</string>
    <string name="chp14_57_1__a">You come to the foothill of a rocky mountain range covered in thick roots and thorns. It is obvious you will not be able to continue east here. Looking north, you see a tangle of the same thin, silvery thread you have been using to trace your way through the woods. It seems others have come this way before. To the south you find tracks leading off into the bushes. Though you cannot discern what may have left the tracks, you are certain something went in that direction.</string>
    <string name="chp14_64_1__a">"Just west of the village, where the taint of the Deepwood once again resumes, you find the graveyard. Small headstones mark the graves of the village's dead. Burial is a luxury few can afford in the cities, however land is plentiful out in the Deepwood and it is not uncommon to find the old custom revived by the pioneer villagers. It is often seen as a mark of respect for one to have a grave dug for them, as any trip into the Deepwood is a life-threatening endeavor.

Treading carefully through the sacred ground, you notice there are four freshly dug graves. Has the village recently suffered a loss, and is now preparing for a funeral? Looking into one of the shallow ditches, you notice some gear sitting at the bottom that could be of use to you.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_64_2__a">Jumping into the hole, you do your best to ignore the impression that you may be stepping into your own grave, and quickly snatch the items. The dead no longer need them anyway.</string>
    <string name="chp14_64_3__c">You decide it would be best to let the dead lie and move on.</string>
    <string name="chp14_67_1__c">Looking above, you find the silver thread tangled in the branches, leading further off into the foothills to the east.</string>
    <string name="chp14_68_1__a">Hacking your way through the thick vines, you come to the base of a mountain. Rocky cliffs border a narrow passage which disappears up into the hillside. This could be the path that finally leads you back to the Wire Road. As you begin the ascent, the walls of the cliff become exceedingly narrow and you find a thick tangle of the silver thread lines blocking the way. Looking closely, however, you realize the lines are not the recovery thread Nydia gave you, but the web of some sort of spider.</string>
    <string name="chp14_68_1__c">"You give the command for everyone to freeze. There are many species of spiders in the Deepwood and none of them are pleasant. Disturbing these webs could bring whatever lurks here down upon you. 

Looking ahead, you find the path leads to a dark tunnel dug into the mountainside. If this passage actually heads back to the Wire Road, you will need to venture through the tunnel to reach it. Rather than risk an ambush by whatever lies inside, you may want to disturb the webs now to draw out any potential predators.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_68_2__a">"Weapons at the ready, you slice down into the webs. Your weapons become tangled in the thick, sticky thread, but each time you are able to free them after a few moments. As you wait for a response, you are greeted only by silence. Wanting to be sure there are no creatures lying in wait, you strike the webs again, snapping several of the threads. Still, silence. It appears no one is home. 

You press further up the path, hacking away the criss-crossing webs. Progress is slow as you are forced to stop every so often to free your weapon from the sticky mass. Eventually, you begin to make some headway, and through the haze of threads see a group of objects at the mouth of the cave."</string>
    <string name="chp14_68_3__a">Not wanting to take any chances against whatever may be waiting up ahead, you turn back toward Refuge.</string>
    <string name="chp14_69_1__c">"You hack away at the webs and slowly but surely cleave a path through to the cave mouth. At the threshold you pause. Plastering the rock walls a dozen bodies are sewn into the walls by a funnel of webbing. You take all precautions to stay silent, and notice they are Scar Tribesmen. Judging by the way their chests rise and fall in rhythm, they are still alive. 

Suddenly, in the shadows ahead, you see eight tiny points of light reflecting in huge, bulbous black eyes. Something vast is staring out of the tunnel mouth right at you. A paralyzing horror creeps over you and it takes all of your willpower to master it. Eyes fixed on the unmoving orbs in the dark you nearly miss movement all around you. As if by some unspoken signal, the bodies split, spewing forth a wave of spiders. What you had assumed to be breathing, was instead the stir of arachnids incubating within a corpse. You slash out with your weapons and immediately perform a fighting retreat. This is no terrain to be caught in. You need to get clear of the passage."</string>
    <string name="chp14_69_1__e">Blood-thristy fangs lunge at you as you hack away at their chitinous limbs. Finally, breaking free of the cave entrance, you put some distance between you and the arachnid host, watching as more and more spiders crawl out of the tunnel. Not waiting to be overrun, you quickly turn heel, and sprint back down the mountain passage. Eight unblinking eyes watch as you go.</string>
    <string name="chp14_69_4__a">Finally clear of the threat, you begin the return journey back to Refuge. The thought of those eyes haunting you every step of the way.</string>
    <string name="chp14_69_4__c">The passage through the mountains is no longer an option. A choke point like that, in the dark, with an unknown number of enemies is death ground. Everything you have learned tells you not to go back in there and there is no guarantee you would find the Wire Road if you did.</string>
    <string name="chp14_83_1__c">"It does not take you long to find the caravan, or what is left of it anyway. The wreckage of overturned carts and horse corpses are scattered on the path ahead. As a precautionary measure, you give the area a quick visual search to be certain there are no creatures lying in wait. 

With the area secured, you investigate the scene. As expected, there are no human remains among the wreckage. Fresh meat never sits long in the Deepwood. However, what you do find peculiar is the fact that there are no blood trails leading off into the woods and the corpses of the horses have been left untouched. Whatever took the merchants did so cleanly and had no interest in consuming horse flesh. 

The spokes on the wheels of the carts have broken and there are gouges in their wooden sides. Taking a closer look, you notice the marks do not appear to have been made by claws or any other kind of beast. They are too clean, as though made by some kind of bladed weapon. Perhaps they encountered a Scar Tribe? Although, you have never known a Scar Tribe to leave behind fresh meat and they most certainly would have left a far greater mess in their wake."</string>
    <string name="chp14_83_1__e">Turning your attention to salvaging any supplies, you begin your search for rations or maps which may help lead you to Thrace.</string>
    <string name="chp14_83_2__a">Digging through the wreckage, you find opened sacks and broken crates, but no rations. It is odd for a caravan of this size not to have been properly stocked with food for such a journey. Before giving up the search you luckily spot some equipment hidden under an overturned cart.</string>
    <string name="chp14_83_2__c">As a dark cloud forms overhead and rain begins to fall, you are left with no choice but to head back to the village for the evening. Yet another day with no sign of a way to escape these dreaded woods.</string>
    <string name="chp14_83_3__a">"After a thorough search, you find nothing here, no food, no maps, nothing of value. There should have at least been some rations found. No caravan setting out on a journey such as this would have left without proper provisions. 

As a dark cloud forms overhead and rain begins to fall, you are left with no choice but to head back to the village for the evening. Yet another day with no sign of a way to escape these dreaded woods."</string>
    <string name="chp14_84_1__a">Carefully studying the terrain as you go, you notice the branches of the Deepwood trees here have clearly been cut by axes. The practice is common among merchants who need to fit their carts and horses through tight spaces in the woods. A caravan passed this way at some point, but the terrain allows for only three possible exits from this area. Trails made by caravans do not last long in the ever-changing landscape of the Deepwood, but if you can pick up the tracks left behind, you may be able to learn where the caravan went.</string>
    <string name="chp14_84_2__c">Following a trail of crushed twigs and the faint impressions of footprints in the mud, you make out the telltale signs of humans traveling west through a small pass between the Deepwood trees and a rocky outcropping.</string>
    <string name="chp14_84_3__a">Despite your best efforts, you are not able to pick up the trail. Whatever traces may have once been left here are long lost to the rain and constant undulations of the noxious Deepwood flora. You are certain the caravan passed through here, but it is unclear which direction they were traveling.</string>
    <string name="chp14_85_1__a">You notice small indentations in the moss growing on the Deepwood floor here. They are faint, but you may be able to track whatever left them.</string>
    <string name="chp14_85_2__a">Looking closely, you recognize the indentations as prints left behind by horse hooves. It seems they passed this way some time ago, heading west.</string>
    <string name="chp14_85_3__a">The moss makes it difficult to discern the type of track left behind. All you can be certain of is something passed through here some time ago, but it is impossible to tell which direction they were heading.</string>
    <string name="chp14_94_1__a">The terrain quickly becomes rocky and difficult to traverse here. No caravan would have been able to continue this way.</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_10__a">"Clydia's eyes fill with tears and the hurt written across her face is impossible to ignore. Without a word, she slowly walks to a nearby table, picking up a backpack and longbow before walking off into the Deepwood alone. None of the other villagers speak to her as she departs. In fact, most take great care to avoid the young woman. She may have been innocent of the bloodshed, but it seems people here would never be able to fully trust her."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_11__a">"After speaking with the villagers, you search Nydia's house and find a map of the area with handwritten notes indicating the section of the Wire Road which had been removed as part of her trap. It should not be too difficult to find your way back now. At first light, you gather as many rations as you can carry and head off into the Deepwood once again, destined for Thrace.

GAIN 32 IRON."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_1__a">"With an earth-shaking thud, the eight-legged monstrosity crashes to the ground, her black, chitinous legs shattered. The egg clusters on her back burst as she shudders in the throes of death. Her remaining young skitter away, no doubt in search of some dark hole to hide in. Leaning heavily on your weapons, you inspect your many wounds to see which will need the most attention. 

Understandably, the villagers are all in shock. They had not expected this outcome either."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_2__a">The villagers fall to their knees before you, shame and remorse bubbling to the surface after all they have been made to do these last few years. Nydia, the Priestess of the Wandering Queen, lies dead where you left her. But what will you do with the rest of these people?</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_3__a">"Nydia rushes to the body of the spider queen, and to your disgust, embraces it. \"My queen!\" she cries. \"What have they done to you?…\" 

Rounding on you with a curse on her lips, Nydia draws a short dagger and lunges at you. Your blade pierces her heart before hers ever lands. Blood pools beneath Nydia's body as she lies beside her queen. Whatever sick power had been at work here hopefully dies with her.

Turning back to the assembled crowd, you see a myriad of emotions - anger, shame, sorrow, confusion. But there is no escaping the fact that these people dared to pick up arms against a Free Company."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_4__a">"Since the pact has been broken, everyone could be considered complicit to one degree or another. They all knew what was happening here, feeding innocent souls to a giant spider for some sort of sorcerous protection. 

A decision must be made, but there is little time to discover all the facts. You could eventually ferret out all those who enforced Nydia's will upon the village and only execute them if you wished. You could also judge them all as one and purge this village from the Deepwood. Or, there is always the option of granting them all clemency. 

Looking over the crowd of villagers, you suddenly see Samil sitting at the central feasting table, watching you with keen interest as though awaiting your decision.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_5__a">"The screaming begins moments after passing your final judgement. The pact must be upheld. It can never waver. The slaughter does not take long. Even as you stalk them through their streets and homes, the villagers desperately cling to the broken circle that once protected them. No one attempts to flee the village as death comes for each of them in turn. 

With judgement complete, you search Nydia's home and find a map revealing the location of the Wire Road. Collecting up the remains of the feast, you take what supplies you can and head back into the Deepwood. At least now you have enough rations to get you to Thrace."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_6__a">"You are able to find the main conspirators quickly. Many villagers are all too willing to give up the identities of Nydia's inner circle after the horrors they have witnessed. Gathering the accused on the edge of the village you pass final judgement, a quick series of deaths to mark your final moments here at Refuge. After the executions, you speak with the remaining villagers."</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_7__a">Your words only deepen the shock on the faces before you. They had all feared the worst, certain of a death sentence. However, by granting them clemency, you have earned both trust and respect this day. With the difficult business done, you take the opportunity to speak with the remaining villagers.</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_8__a">"Each person you talk to shares a similar story. The villagers had grown desperate before Nydia arrived, often suffering attacks from the Scar Tribes throughout the region. But that all stopped the moment Nydia took over and implemented her ways. It all began with the sacrifice of a few criminals, people already marked for death. The very day the first souls were condemned, both the Deepwood and the Tribes were immediately held at bay. As time went on, things slowly changed, and Nydia took greater control over everyone's lives. Dissenters were the first to be sacrificed. Once her authority was no longer challenged, she ordered the villagers to cut the Wire Road and began preying on wayward travelers who were funneled through Refuge. All Nydia ever asked of them was that they turn a blind eye to the carnage. 

The one person who may have suffered most throughout this time was Nydia's own daughter, Clydia. The young woman was held captive for years inside her home all because she refused to go along with her mother's murderous scheme. \"She couldn't bring herself to sacrifice me, but she would never allow me to leave either. All I want is to leave this place and never to return. Will you take me with you? I'm good with a bow, and I can take care of myself.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp14_epi_9__c">"\"Thank you so much,\" Clydia says, her eyes glisten with tears of joy. \"I promise I won't let you down.\" She retrieves her backpack and bow from a nearby table. Apparently, she had been confident enough you would accept her into your Free Company that she packed her things before asking. Or perhaps she was preparing to leave this place even if you refused her."</string>

In the masked one's hands is a barbed whip that drips with the blood of those behind them. Thrace: The City of Masks, where the only ones considered human are those who hide their faces behind porcelain. The whispers of the city gave the rest a few names: Stock, Nameless, or the Faceless. Perhaps you will find the witch you need for The Keening in this foreign place.

Three scowling stone hounds are perched over the only archway into the estate, their fangs a warning and their eyes a bitter welcome. The courtyard is populated by more statues than people - statues of wolves, lions, and of massive creatures with great tusks. Faceless tend to various Masked, and two palanquins, borne by six Faceless each, pass you by. As you survey the grounds, it becomes apparent just how many little passageways and hidden rooms there are - perfect for Thracian politicking.

\"May I be of service in your investigation?\" he asks, albeit weakly. \"This slave could be useful. I know the city. Can carry heavy things. Talk to other Nameless. I can serve… please.\"

You eye the man's bruised face. 

\"If they take me back, they will…\"

You can see the color flowing back into his limbs and when he looks at you, you see his face is warped with scars.

Faceless are handed around between the masters of the estate. Until yesterday I served another of house Amiese.\" 

You are not surprised by the servant's reply, the Faceless are no doubt trained to keep their back bent and eyes low around the Masked ones. The lack of information does not faze you though, all you need now is to find your suspect. One quick answer and you will have your witch for The Keening.

The flower near the body is likely to have only come from one place in the city. Warded by a high wall, a trench, and a watchful guard, the gardens do little to welcome you. Yet, inside, the colors of Thrace intensify. You see crimson tulips and great white daffodils stretching for the sun while soft peach petals dance in the light wind. The flowers here are worth more than gold and you see three Masked gardeners tending to them. Right enough, you find a stretch of that same periwinkle flower that was pressed into Mordren's boot. 

\"He was here,\" says Nacosta.

The gardeners confirm your suspicions. 

\"There was an argument, and a pretty loud one,\" the gardener says. \"There were just the two of them. A few nights ago between the Amiese heir and someone else. Curses and threats from both. I didn't get too close, but whoever the Amiese son met with, they entered the gardens through the north gate. Just after sundown.\"

\"And in return, you will have your witch,\" says the Amiese. \"By tomorrow night, at the Curiate Assembly, we will expect your conclusion.\"

At the far end of the string of thrones, the black serpentine mask speaks. \"They should be told of Rubeo,\" the Pytone says, his 'r's rolling.

\"He's a ghost story the Faceless like to tell themselves,\" says the dog faced Carnedine.

\"A ghost story that has killed more of us than you would like to admit,\" adds the Pytone. 

\"I have seen the teardrop mask myself, Carnedine,\" bites the Lignja. 

\"If you had, you wouldn't be here,\" begins the Volpe. \"Whether a ghost or not, he works to thwart our improvement of Thrace while killing us where he can.\" You ask whether this Rubeo could be responsible for the Amiese's death but the Volpes mask shakes. \"He works in spectacle, owning his crimes, little more than a thespian masquerading as a revolutionary. This is too subtle.\"

Nods from some of the Five accompany the Volpe's claim as the Amiese returns to the matter at hand. \"The Five know who you are and will not impede your investigation.

My eldest son, Mordren, was found dead in the Low Districts, his head shaved and neck slit clean the way only the Assassins' Guild can. However, this is not a Sanctioned Mark, but an illegal killing.

\"I… I'm sorry for the intrusion, but it is you, isn't it?\" the child asks with excitement. \"You're a legend! You were one of the Twelve Blades! 

Gesturing toward an unmarked section of the mask, he asks, \"I was wondering. May I get your notch?\"

The Cattedrale stands as a testament to Thracian iconography. The corridors, towers, tombs, and pillars are all built in the warped forms of snakes, bears, and foreign creatures you do not recognize. As you approach, you hear chanting rising from within. Despite the protestations of the Red Maidens, you are allowed access to the building when you tell them Mordren sent you. Few would risk the wrath of a Free Company, fewer still would risk it from the Amiese. You eventually find your way into the vast network of tunnels beneath the Cattedrale, just as the Lignja said. Inside, you find a cavern filled with dozens of flasks and a sour scent in the air. Boiled amber. It may not be deadly, but it is a hallucinogenic and deeply addictive. The substance is forbidden under the King's Law, but that means little here, so far from the throne. You see Faceless working in the dim light, branded with the Ant and the Dog - the Amiese and the Carnedine.

\"This was meant to be a joint operation,\" explains an Amiese guardsman. \"But it had become… difficult. Mordren wanted to double production, but the Carnedine were considering scrapping the whole operation, saying it was destroying the Faceless stock. One of the Carnedine was here last night, but left in urgency just before sundown. He headed south to meet with someone.\"

Dozens of servants tend to each of them with food, drink and warm towels. Your own servant, Nacosta, was barred from joining you, left outside in the cold. 

The four suspects sit arrayed before the assembly: the Pytone, the Carnedine, the Volpe, and the Lignja. Those assembled want a name, a mask they can exact their grievance against.

The Catacombs, considered a place of memory in Thrace, as well as where the secrets of the Five are kept, is marked only by a small dome, the tip of which is built into the earth like an upturned hive. \"The Nameless are forbidden,\" a guard barks, leveling his spear to bar Nacosta from entry. \"You may enter, Oathsworn, but not with that.

\"I was meant to die,\" repeats the slave. 

\"I?\" questions the Masked man.

\"This slave was meant to die,\" cries the slave.

\"Worthless,\" the man says, spitting on her. \"The iron is in your blood, not your arm.\"

The air is thick with death. It is an acrid scent, and vivid, like footsteps in mud. It leads you past the herds of Faceless, who cower and congeal together in their fragile shacks, down a single street toward an isolated cluster of sheds that they all avoid. All have their doors closed. They are draped in morbidity. 

They are locked, but you break in easily. Inside you find foul-smelling piles - not of material or excrement - but bodies. Dozens of bodies, stacked and organized like bricks, layer atop layer to utilize the space most efficiently. In one corner, you find a woman still breathing. Gasping for air, she is clearly not long for this world. Taking her by the hand you ask her what happened here.

\"The water, it is death,\" she says, motioning her head slowly toward a bucket. \"They would force us to drink, then keep us here to see what would happen. Why…\" she rasps, her question unfinished as she falls still. Laying her hand back in the dirt, you consider the implications."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_20_2__a">"The horror reveals the truth. The Pytone is experimenting on his own Faceless with some kind of poison, and he is even keeping their bodies to hide it. You know he wants revenge but against who? Using mass poison against the Faceless would be a major operation and hard to conceal. Where will the hammer fall?

Stepping into the heavily guarded Pytone compound gives one the sense of entering a viper's den. Walkways snake between expertly manicured topiaries depicting coiled bodies and the fanged maws of vipers. Shallow aqueducts irrigate the estate's gardens and supply numerous fountains with rushing waters that mask indiscreet conversations from prying ears. Every aspect of the manse evokes a malicious, serpentine quality that reminds all to tread carefully here, even Oathsworn. 

Soon after entering the estate, a squad of masked guards approaches, barring your path. Brandishing your Oathmark does little to sway them and it becomes clear you will not be allowed any further without a fight. Opting for the diplomatic approach, you back away and search for other means of collecting the information you need. Perhaps the Servants' Quarters will be of more use."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_23_1__a">"Location 23 - Lignja Grounds

A domed structure covered in a glittering mosaic, full of symmetry and patterns, dominates the Lignja grounds. A dozen tentacles reach out along the ground, across walls, over archways, and each tentacle ends at a tower. They are domed but crowned with a golden spire. 

You are approached by a lesser Lignja family member. Though young, he hobbles, and you see ambition twinkle in his eyes. 

\"I am not naive. I know why you are here, much as my mother would devour you for it. I am not as blind as her though, I see further and all I will say is, I've heard the Pytone Faceless District smells fouler than usual for this time of year.\""</string>

Several creatures have been impaled in their attempts to breach the city. Upon finally reaching the place the Amiese pointed you toward, you realize you have been tricked. There is nothing here. You go to turn back then realize you are not alone. Off in the woods, you see a dozen hungry eyes closing fast."</string>

Labyrinthine halls contort into the earth. Nobody notices a Faceless entering the mushroom plantations - another Faceless among hundreds - but they eye you with suspicion, till you disappear into the shadowy wings of the Underways.

After following the endless root-like tunnels of the city, a great underground expanse suddenly opens up before you. Pillars of stalactites and stalagmites stab the air and hold up the roof. There are hundreds of Faceless, and even a few Masked, under the glum orange amber light. The secrecy speaks of only one thing: resistance. 

Polus weaves you through the crowds and up a staircase carved from rock to a platform overlooking the expanse. There are five people - three women, two men, one of whom has a cat-like mask at his belt - all bent around a table of papers. 

\"Wyman,\" says Polus, and a tall golden hawkish woman turns. Her bottom lip is pinched. 

\"Polus and I know who you are and why you are here. We saw what you did in the Coliseum. We admire it, but if you're here for iron, we aren't paying you. Instead, we will ask more of you. Five families control Thrace. The Volpe, Lignja, Amiese, Carnedine, and Pytone. Each worse than the last. One of the Five is planning something. Their petty feuds are usually kept to the death of their own. Usually we are happy to watch them eat one another but there are rumors of something bigger. We fear this plan will target the Faceless.\" 

A second man's voice is a wheeze, \"We need those Oathmarks of yours to find out what. You can get places we can't. There is a masquerade ball at the Curiate Assembly, a sinful display of decadence and opulence. Your brand will get you in.\"

\"But using any witch spells death!\" bites another. 

\"You may find her when following this path, and if you do, she is yours.\" 

You wonder at the motives of any group of rebellious slaves who would so easily hand over another to be bound, but this lead is all you have. You ask for more details on this plot against the faceless.

\"We are afraid, we only know one thing for sure, a message was intercepted speaking of the hammer falling on the third flame of Eran. We have little time. We must learn what form this hammer will take, where, and who wields it, to have a chance at stopping it.\"

The leaders then deliberate among themselves, sharing glances of trepidation and uncertainty.

\"There's something else. Rubeo is on the same trail,\" she says, defying her comrades.

\"We do not know that for s-\"

\"They deserve to know. He is no saint.\""</string>

The Pytone sits inside a solitary palanquin held aloft by a dozen Faceless, and only a handful of guards in addition to yourselves seem to be present. The iron gates of the Pytone estate swing back and the procession begins. As you pass through into the street you can feel the Pytone's gaze settle on you. 

\"I was beginning to wonder if you would make it, Oathsworn,\" he hisses, and something drops inside you. \"It's been interesting to watch you scurry about my city, picking up on the little breadcrumbs I left you - my people all leading you here.\"

He pours himself a goblet of wine as you walk. It spills when a Faceless stumbles.

\"Before you think of doing anything stupid, know if I should die here, thousands of Amiese Faceless will too. Arrangements have been made in case of my untimely demise and the hammer will fall on that upstart family of usurpers. My revenge has been a long time coming and I would savor it so very much, yet if I get what I want, my hand may be stayed.

I acquired one to assist in brewing the poison - much harder for the Alveare to remedy when the malefic is involved.\"

You ask the Pytone why he wants Rubeo dead and his reply is filled with venom, \"The runt has sought my head for many moons. Made me a prisoner in my own home. No longer. My men have failed to track the fool down, yet your presence here has lent me an opportunity,\" he smiles. \"The snake is not so easily snared.

\"Would you not kick a dog that bites you, without a thought? Or kill ants that steal your sugar? The Amiese is an ant that needs crushing. They'll recover one day,\" he says dismissively. \"Oh, you mean the Faceless?\" the Pytone asks with a start. \"Death can be cruel, but death can also be practical. They have homes, water, food. They accept their place and understand a few dying here and there is part of their good deal. If they really hated our way of life, they would rebel. After all, there are thousands of them and so few of us.\" 

\"In any case, should you wish to save them, you'd best listen carefully,\" he continues. \"There is one thing I want more than dead ants and that is Rubeo. You are about to kill that immortal weasel for me. Do it, and the Faceless will be spared.

A knife whistles down and the Pytone ducks into his palanquin. The Faceless halt, a couple flee and are shot with arrows in the back. 

\"Making deals with demons, Oathsworn?\" growls Rubeo. He lands before you, surely no man could have made that drop.

\"I knew I could draw you out, you degenerate coward!\" baits the Pytone. He then gets out of his palanquin and positions himself behind you. \"Know this Oathsworn, should I die our deal dies with me and the order for tomorrow morning goes through. They will all die, and you get no witch.\"

It is built atop stilts of stone, on a hillish rise, with not so much as a wooden rail to prevent one from falling over its edge. Dozens of Faceless take on the roles of hooks for coats and even footrests for those members in lesser fox masks sitting about, who each eye you with suspicion.

It is clear who wields the hammer in Thrace, and you know where to find it. The Pytone has been stockpiling a deadly poison and sending it to the Cattedrale. He wants to use it against the Faceless of another family, but which one?

Entering, you search the grand nave and passages of the Cattedrale, but glean nothing. The Cattedrale stands as a testament to Thracian iconography. The corridors, towers, pillars and tombs are built in the warped forms of snakes, bears and foreign creatures you do not recognize, not even from the Deepwood. 

\"We don't know what they are,\" says a balding man, pointing above. \"Beasts of legends, maybe. From the world before the Deepwood.\" Leaning in closer, he whispers, \"I know why you are here, follow me. Pretend we are admiring the art, yes?\" 

He leads you down the transept to an otherwise innocuous wall, save for a keyhole. \"The Red Maidens allow the defiling of our Cattedrale. They may defile this holy place, but I will not.\"

Then, with a heavy key from his robes, the priest unlocks it to reveal a stairway leading down.

    <string name="chp15b_8_20__a">"As you make your way back down the stairs, a flash of movement catches your eye a moment before an instrumentalist keels over screaming. Shards of glass from a shattered stained glass window hit the woman in the face as a Masked man crashes through and lands on the banquet table. Six guards rush the figure, but he cuts them down in three swift movements. A demonstration of skill as elegant as the masquerade dance itself. 

About the room, you hear scatterings of, \"Rubeo,\" and \"He's real!\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_21__a">"The crowd parts before you as Rubeo twirls his blades, his gray, masked eyes hardening. 

\"You would defend this pit of adders, Oathsworn? They may not have shown you their fangs yet, but do not be fooled. Fools die in Thrace.\" At that he throws a vial of liquid at the floor and disappears in a cloud of smoke."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_22__a">"Satisfied he has the room's full attention, Rubeo swings a sack from his back and dumps its contents. Five severed heads hit the table with a wet thud, one for each lesser member of the Five families.

\"The one who plots against the Faceless will be dead by dawn, unless they call off their plans. Any who are aware of the plans and fail to stop them, will end up just like these,\" he says, motioning to the heads on the table. 

Hosts of Masked guardsmen quickly flood the room, surrounding Rubeo. Calmly, Rubeo's teardrop mask sweeps the room and with a swift motion of his wrist, throws a vial of liquid at the floor. Rubeo disappears in a cloud of smoke. When the smoke clears, only his message remains. As Masked nobles scurry for the exits, you notice the Volpe and the Lignja leave together without an accompaniment, heading southward from the Curiate Assembly."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_23__a">"Daggers fly from the smoke, catching you off guard. As you advance into the cloud, Rubeo attacks, his knives dancing around you. Powerful legs and fists knock you off balance and one of you falls to the ground. As the smoke clears, you rise to your feet and find Rubeo pressing down on your chest with his blade to your throat. You all freeze.

\"This I swear,\" he says, looking at you, but speaking to all. \"The one who plots against the Faceless will be dead by dawn unless they call off their plans. Any who are aware of the plans and fail to stop them, will end up just like these.\" Rising, Rubeo drops a sack onto the banqueting table with a wet thud. As if in response to his words, a host of Masked guardsmen flood the room. Calmly sweeping his teardrop mask across the room he throws a second vial of liquid at the floor. When the smoke clears, he is gone. You move to inspect the contents of the sack and find five severed heads, one for each lesser member of the Five families. Rubeo has made his message clear.

At the sight of the heads, many of the Masked nobles quickly make for the exits. You notice the Volpe and the Lignja leave together without any accompaniment, speaking closely."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_24__c">"Polus rejoins you in the aftermath, having eavesdropped throughout the evening at your behest. Her dark eyes speak to what she must have heard. 

\"Most of them talk about nothing. Fashion, Verum, iron, wine, more wine. But there were two who were talking about… you. They were watching you, and spoke of having eyes on you ever since Bastone. I heard them say there are mightier hands than theirs at work, moving pieces in Verum, Thrace, Cistercia, and the Deepwood.\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_25__c">"Polus' pants spill with iron as she rejoins you. 

\"I hope I did well,\" she says, looking up with cupped hands and a crooked grin. \"I do not mean to beg, but… can you spare some for my sisters?\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_26__c">"Polus' snooping seems to have reaped its rewards. She unpacks the drawbag she took with her. \"Everyone was in the main hall. Barely a guard in the rest of the building.\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_29__a">You know the Pytone wants revenge and has been poisoning his own people in preparation for some decisive move. Who is it aimed at though?</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_2__a">"Wine abounds at this hedonistic gathering, more than you have ever seen. Those of the Five Great Masks - the Volpe, the Carnedine, the Amiese and the Lignja, - are all present, with one exception. The Pytone. 

\"The fruits of the new farmland,\" says a squid masked Lignja. \"Thrace is blessed by the Oldmother. She works through the Prunings everyday.\"

\"We need to do something about the tunnels beneath the Cattedrale,\" says another. \"Too many escape there. They could be anywhere now.\"

Every pair or trio you pass instinctually halts conversation or changes topics in an instant. Those you do speak with hide behind pleasantries. Eavesdropping will have to suffice."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_30__a">You know it is the Pytone who want revenge, but against whom will the hammer fall and by what means?</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_3__a">"Overlooking the balcony, you find a Volpe and Carnedine partaking of wine and secrets.

\"It's been in the wind that the Pytone is looking for revenge,\" says the Volpe, her voice drifting. 

\"The same wind that's been blowing for years, then,\" chuckles the Carnedine. \"Snappy little upstarts.\"

\"This time is different. Rumors in the Low Districts are that his masks have been seen in the Gardens and the Catacombs.\"

\"Around the city? Who would have thought one of the most powerful men-\"

The Volpe suddenly pivots. \"He's targeting one of us. I've heard the Lignja knows more.\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_4__a">"Overlooking the balcony, you find the Volpe and Carnedine partaking of wine and secrets.

Accidentally walking into a table, you catch their attention, interrupting their conversation."</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_5__a">"Moving on, you find an Amiese poised on a bridge over the hall. He appears statuesque behind the glimmering mask as he whispers to a female Lignja dressed in a Deepwood green gown. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot Polus.

\"…a Pruning planned for the north-west. A final push after no Deepwood sightings for a month. My lady Lignja, if you'd lend-\" He quickly turns on snakeskin heels to face you. \"Oathsworn, I see courtesy is a foreign currency in Verum, but it's worth more than iron here. As is - what is your word - privacy? What interest do Oathsworn have in a masquerade? Not enough throats to slit here.\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_6__c">\"Is that so?\" the Lignja says, her eyes narrowing behind her mask. \"I am sure I would have heard if such an invasion of privacy were taking place.\"</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_7__c">"\"Ah. The wine is good, thick, and plenty, but it also dulls your senses and it doesn't look like yours have far to fall.\""</string>
    <string name="chp15b_8_9__c">\"A fear many here have, though they dare not show it. We wear masks to hide many things.\"</string>
    <string name="chp15b_9_1__a">"Location 9 - The Catacombs

The Catacombs, considered a place of memory in Thrace, as well as where the secrets of the Five are kept, is marked only by a small dome, the tip of which is built into the earth like an upturned hive. A spiral stairwell escorts you down into the bowels of the city, deeper than the Underways and somehow darker, despite the torches. The air is like thick wine and the shadows are predatory, limiting your vision. 

Continuing on, you enter a circular room. Its width is so vast you can barely make out the outline of six doors set into the curved wall. Each one is winged by a pair of amber torches and emblazoned with a familiar symbol: an ant, a fox, a dog, a squid and a snake. The sixth one features an unidentified creature defaced by deep gouges. Why six?"</string>
    <string name="chp15b_9_2__a">"Each door features an iron plaque. They are mostly written in an unfamiliar language, but the words remain mesmerizing somehow. They are not family words, but something different - perhaps a list of accomplishments. The Carnedine plaque describes their greatest Coliseum gladiators, The Blades. The Amiese's proclaims them to be the hive of a thousand workers. The Volpe's description has clearly been replaced in recent years, 'Peace, Order, and Peace Again', it reads. You decipher that the Lignja plaque speaks to the greatest spy network in Thrace and the Pytone plaque is indecipherable. The sixth door, however, has no plaque. It has been filed down and whatever words there might have been are gone.

    <string name="chp16_10_10__c">"After an exhaustive search of the building, you finally discover a hidden doorway behind some old crates and miscellaneous junk. As you begin to shove aside the blockade, an old Faceless woman approaches you timidly. \"It is haunted,\" she tells you. \"You shouldn't go in there. No one has ever come back.\" With those 'encouraging' words ringing in your ears, you head into the darkness of the tower."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_11__a">"Closing the door behind you, the sounds from the outside world are muffled and all you can hear is a light wind howling through the long hallway that stretches away before you. Taking careful steps you begin to sense that you are not alone here. Suddenly, you hear a quiet tapping from somewhere behind the walls. As you press further ahead into the poorly lit hallway, you nearly trip over a pile of bones. Striking your amber torches, you look closely at the remains and notice the skeleton appears to be fairly fresh, though stripped of its flesh. 

The tapping noises grow louder as you continue, and soon more tapping sounds join in. Eventually, you come to the crumbling remains of an old staircase. Lifting your torches high, you can see dozens of small holes carefully arranged in a pattern on the walls. Stepping back for a wider view, you notice the shape of a great scarab. This place once belonged to the Scaravelho. 

Continuing your search, the amber light of your torch reflects off a black carapace, which suddenly jerks as the light washes over it. Chitinous legs extend from a fat carapace and you watch as the scarab scuttles off into one of the many holes in the wall. The low hum of scratching fills your ears when suddenly hundreds of fat scarabs pour from every hole like black rivers."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_11__c">"Dozens of the black scarabs crawl over you, their jaws snapping at your exposed flesh. Jumping back, you bring your amber torches to bear on the swarm, fighting off those already stuck to you. Your group bands together, forming a ring of light on the ground as the insects gush around you like water around a rock. The only thing saving you from a horrid death is the amber light. As the swarm passes by, it continues down the hallway before disappearing into a large hole at the opposite end. Luckily, you suffer only a few bloody scratches, with your armor absorbing most of the damage. It is now clear why the Faceless thought this building was haunted. 

Continuing your search, you discover a lever halfway up the damaged staircase. Pulling it, you hear the scrape of metal on stone as a series of plates pass in front of the holes on the walls, blocking the Scarabs from reentering the passageway. It seems this hallway may have been one of the ways the Scaravelho family rid themselves of their enemies, a method as clever as it is horrific. 

Climbing the broken staircase, you enter the upper part of the tower and learn this must have been the private wing of the head of the Scaravelho family. Despite the dust, the room is almost completely untouched by time as pieces of old banners still hang from the walls, reminding all of the once-great magnificence of the Scaravelho family. You find some human remains scattered on the floor, their crushed bones and contorted body positions indicating they were most likely killed in a battle."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_12__a">Amongst the chattels in the room, you find a few usable items and trinkets that may fetch a few iron before returning your focus to the bones on the floor.</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_14__a">"Examining one of the skeletons, it appears to be from a male and looks as though it were flung against the wall, shattering its bones. Within arm's reach, you also find a broken knife, unblemished by rust or time, lying beside what looks like a dried piece of bark. However, as you inspect the object more closely, it appears that it may be part of an insect or some other animal.

Looking toward the far wall, you find a massive, gaping hole open to the Deepwood beyond. 

Lying in a pile of rubble by the hole, you find a sealed letter that had never been delivered."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_1__a">"10 - Carnedine Grounds

You walk along the Carnedine grounds searching for any clues of the history that may still be visible here. Looking at the architecture and stonework, it is hard to imagine anyone other than the Carnedine ever living here. Suddenly, you recognize familiar features from the sketches you examined earlier. Broken pillars and sections of old building foundations are still visible at the base of the new structures built on top. Perhaps you can find more clues inside this family estate."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_4__a">"As you approach the guards at the gate, they recognize you and block the entrance. \"Pytone hatchlings do not enter here,\" says one of the guards. \"We know your neutrality, Oathsworn.\" 

With the gate so heavily guarded, it will not be possible to enter here. However, looking through the entrance archway, you notice a decrepit tower which looks remarkably similar to one of the sketches you saw."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_5__a">Had you tried to enter the Carnedine estate just one day earlier, you would have easily gained access as the adjudicator in the Amiese murder. Now, however, things have changed. With tensions escalating throughout the city, each of the five families have vastly increased the manpower on their grounds. The Carnedine estate now resembles a fortress. When you approach the gate guards, they deny you entrance. However, looking through the archway of the gate, you notice a decrepit tower which looks remarkably similar to one of the sketches you saw.</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_6__a">"Circling around the Carnedine grounds, you enter the Faceless district and search for the decrepit tower. Once locating it, you begin to search for a point of entry and quickly realize your options are limited. The Faceless have their sleeping quarters in the building adjacent to it, however there is no obvious way to slip between the two structures. 

Perhaps one of the Faceless may have information about how to gain access to the tower."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_7__a">"A Faceless woman understands what it is you seek and shows you to a door hidden behind some old crates and miscellaneous junk. \"It is haunted,\" she tells you. \"You shouldn't go in there. No one has ever come back.\" With those 'encouraging' words ringing in your ears, you head into the darkness of the tower."</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_8__a">Each Faceless you approach avoids your gaze, with most simply falling to their knees before you and muttering apologies. You will have to search for an entrance on your own.</string>
    <string name="chp16_10_9__a">"After studying the layout of the building and its positioning as it relates to the tower, you eventually find a hidden door behind some old crates and miscellaneous junk.

    <string name="chp16_12_1__a">"Location 12 - The Foregate

You head to the Foregate, intent on discovering more clues about the caravan that was recently assaulted. As you approach, you notice a group of masked guards without animal ornamentation speaking amongst each other. Their conversation drops to a whisper as you pass."</string>
    <string name="chp16_12_3__a">"\"I've heard the Pytone are planning to kill a whole bunch of Faceless. This city is really going to the dogs, ain't it?\""</string>
    <string name="chp16_12_4__a">\"Are you blind? The families are fighting openly on the streets now and the Guild has more marks than they can handle. Powers are shifting. Thrace may not have five ruling families for much longer.\"</string>
    <string name="chp16_12_5__a">"All eyes turn to you as your group steps beside the guard squads. Singling out the officer amongst them, you inquire about the caravan. 

\"A Lignja merchant caravan,\" answers the sergeant, a toned woman with short, braided hair. \"Something huge hit them. There were no survivors, except for one of their Faceless. It was babbling about something, but it sounded like nonsense to me.\" Deciding to be more direct, you specifically ask if it could have been the Ogre.

\"An immortal monster stalking the woods? That is merely an old fableman's tale,\" the sergeant says derisively. \"I've got real threats to deal with,\" she continues, waving you away. \"The remnants of the caravan are just beyond the wall, along the third Wire, see for yourself.\""</string>
    <string name="chp16_14_1__a">"14 - Pytone Servant Quarter

Your inquiries into the Swan family are met with mocked laughter. Few seem to have heard of the noble house, except for a solitary old man. \"Swan, you say?\" he asks. \"They all died out years ago. Even if there were any of 'em left today, they wouldn't live this deep in the web any longer.\""</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_10__a">"Blow by blow, you engage in a warrior's dance. Even with improvisation, a perfect choreography results in a spectacular fight. A true performance for the masses. Your last blow drives through a gap in the armor on Many Winters' side, drawing blood, though not fatally wounding the bear. The armor will hide what is an inconsequential wound. With a mighty roar, the warbear falls to his knees. Had you not known otherwise, you would have believed him to be dead. The crowd cheers and howls in approval. For them, this was good entertainment.

After the performance, you collect Many Winters' body. Dragging his huge frame on a litter outside the Coliseum and into a side alley. Only then does the Ursus move. Standing tall, he looks up to the sky and then to you. The mighty warbear offers his thanks and asks to join your Free Company for the next chapter in his saga.

    <string name="chp16_17_11__a">"Many Winters attacks with a fury you were not prepared to face. Despite your overwhelming numbers, none of you can penetrate the warbear's defenses. Instinct seems to have taken over and his blows are unrelenting. As the weapons fly, you take a nasty blow to your side and the blade bites deep into your flesh. As you fall to your knees, bloodied before him, guards rush in and ensnare Many Winters in hooked chains, driving him back into his pen with long spears. The crowd cheers and laughs at your humiliation and failure, good entertainment for them. There will be no way to free Many Winters from his bondage now."</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_12__a">True to his word, Many Winters shares what he knows of the Ogre of Thrace. He explains how the creature is covered in great scabs of armor that peel from its flesh. This causes the fiend incredible pain, however the scabs are nearly impervious to attacks, even from an Ursus. The only weakness Many Winters could find was the soft fleshy parts left behind by a freshly peeled scab.</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_12__c">Offering the Ursus the chance to complete his hunt, he runs great iron claws over his chest and gives you a predatory smile that sets all your survival instincts on edge.</string>

    <string name="chp16_17_1__a">"17 - The Coliseum Pits

Stepping into the dark corridors beneath the Coliseum, the thick stench of death and sweat hangs in the air like a cloud. You have been told one of the beastmasters here may have seen the Ogre. While gladiators look on from behind iron bars, you question some of the gamemakers. It does not take long to learn that the Beastmaster you seek is no longer counted amongst the living. It seems he had been slain recently by the very creature you yourself saw in the arena. There is little empathy for the man. Only fools would dare try to enslave the wild creatures of the Deepwood. Such an insane undertaking would be unheard of in any other city or town. 

Walking back to the surface, you are about to leave when you hear a deep rumble emanate from one of the cells, \"You hunt the Ogre?\" it says. Drawing closer to the cell, you see a hulking shape in the shadows. Thick, hot breath billows between the bars and you can sense the size of the thing within. You retrieve an amber torch from a sconce and draw it in front of the cage. Towering above you, is the immense frame of an armored Ursus. Shackled to the floor of the cell he is carving strange shapes into the wall using nothing but his thumb claw."</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_2__a">"You look at the runes adorning your kin, all tales of combat and valor. You see the metal that he wears is full of them. With nothing else to record on, he took to inscribing his saga on the walls, the floor, even the ceiling. He has been here a long time. The smell he gives off is one of age and potency. Being caged has not dulled his strength, with a thick paw he thumps his chest and declares his name to be, 'Many Winters'.

You are able to communicate with the old bear and learn how he came to be in this place. It seems he too had been hunting the Ogre of Thrace and had found his quarry, but had not fared well in the ensuing battle and was mortally wounded. Left for dead in the Deepwood, slavers eventually found him and dragged him back to Thrace where he was sold into the pits. He has been here ever since. He offers to share his knowledge of the Ogre and accompany you on the hunt, if you would only free him from his cell. 

Such a proud creature is not made for cages. This is a far strider like yourself and he deserves to be free. You turn to your companions with the first request you have ever made, 'Free Him'. The significance of your request is not lost on your companions and they think how such a feat could be achieved. With the amount of guards between you and the exit you cannot just walk out with the Ursus. 

Alive, the Ursus has value and is carefully guarded. Dead, however, the Ursus would be free. You are certain any pit boss would welcome a bout between a Free Company and an Ursus in the arena. Put on a convincing enough show and the Ursus could fein death. Blood would need to be spilt, but afterwards Many Winters could be taken for dead and discarded. Speaking the plan to the Ursus, he seems begrudged to do such a cowardly thing, yet you imagine his many other attempts at a more direct approach have met in failure. He knows it may be his only option. With a short blow of air from his nostrils, the Ursus agrees, and now you just need to decide if it is worth the risk.

Being caged has clearly not dulled his strength though. As you look into his eyes, the mighty bear thumps his fist against his chest and declares his name to be, 'Many Winters'.

    <string name="chp16_17_5__a">It does not take long for you to find the owner of Many Winters and offer to fight the warbear. Even when you stipulate that you want the body of the Ursus if you win, the masked man eagerly accepts. A battle between a Free Company and an Ursus will certainly draw a crowd.</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_5__c">"Later that evening, the Coliseum is packed with Masked as well as Faceless. The audience erupts into cheers of bloodlust as you are brought into the arena and chants start for 'The Oathsworn'. However, as Many Winters is led into the arena on a leash, the crowd boos and spits in disgust. They treat him like a lowly animal. 

In order for this to work, the fight must appear real. Blood will need to be shed. But you must also be careful not to kill Many Winters in the process. Squaring off against the great, ursine warrior, you offer him a nod and as one, your Free Company attacks."</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_6__a">"You did not come here to free slaves. You have a job to do, and there is no time to lose.

You turn your back on the mighty Ursus and his roar follows you up the corridor."</string>
    <string name="chp16_17_9__a">"The combat is fierce. Weapons swing and clang, iron meeting iron in a violent dance. Lost in the moment, one of your blows lands, finding a gap in the immense armor worn by Many Winters and slides deep into his flesh. The mortal wound brings the warbear to his knees as his lifeblood trickles down his dirty fur. The dying bear utters only two words to you before collapsing, \"Good hunt.\" 

The crowd cheers and howls in approval. For them, this was a good night of entertainment. But you have killed a potential ally, making your prize earnings hollow."</string>
    <string name="chp16_18_1__a">"18 - Waterways

Barges filled with goods, slaves and nobles trickle down the tainted canals of the waterways. The smell is overpowering and you can see why the masked ones are burning incense on the decks of their barges. Looking around, you find no clues to your mission, noting only that the buildings lining the canals have an ancient design and appear to have been built on top of older structures."</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_11__a">\"Place them on the stone,\" the voice says. Together, the three of you grab your companion, and drag them into the circle as they struggle for their life.</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_12__a">Looking at each other, you all realize that you are up against stronger forces than any mere Free Company can handle. You will need all the help you can get, whatever the cost. \"Place them on the stone,\" the voice says as you fix each other with hard stares. Your minds feel thick and a red haze blurs your vision. You must keep your wits about you if you are to get out of here. One of you will not be leaving this circle and you know it. For the first time you draw weapons on each other.</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_13__c">Refusing the offer, your words come out louder than intended, echoing through the surrounding trees with an unnatural rumble. \"Curious,\" the voice remarks as the echo fades, as though surprised by your restraint. You feel the presence slowly fade away as the mighty roar of the Ogre of Thrace rises once again, closer than ever before. Your defiance of the voice has bought you time to prepare for the fight, and just as your group readies themselves, a tree crashes down and you see a creature holding one end of it like a club. A giant covered in great seething scabs stands before you, easily three times the height of a man. As it lets loose a blood-curdling roar, you feel blood trickle from your ears. Mycelle, the Ogre of Thrace, has come.</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_14__a">"It feels as though you are lost in a dream as you drag your companion to the stone circle and tie them down with the heavy iron chain. The voice's laughter echoes around you as you take up a knife and plunge it down into the heart of your companion. You tell yourself you must use every opportunity that is given, every tool that is available to survive what is to come. A great power surges within you as the life from your companion fades."</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_14__c">You sense the presence of the voice fade away and with it, the delirium that has consumed you. Rushing from the stone circle, you struggle to reconcile what you have just done. Had you really just killed one of your own? Struggling to clear your mind, a tree suddenly crashes down and you see a creature holding one end of it like a club. A giant covered in great seething scabs stands before you, easily three times the height of a man. As it lets loose a blood-curdling roar, you feel blood trickle from your ears. Mycelle, the Ogre of Thrace, has come.</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_1__a">"19 - Ruins in the Deepwood

Checking your compass, you skirt around the city wall and out into the green to the east. Amongst the trees you find depressions in the earth, as though great fists had pounded the land. And heading in deeper, you find trees snapped and broken. Some great force has been unleashed here. 

In one of the depressions, you find Samil sitting on the forest floor cross-legged and staring at a female skeleton wearing a Scarab ring. You have seen rings like it worn by other Thracian nobles from the five families. You don't believe this is a coincidence and surmise this must be the author of the letters you have been following, Mycelle's wife. Moving closer, you note the damage to the body. The woman had been crushed by an immense force. 

Much to your surprise, Samil does not disappear as you approach, but merely continues to gaze into the skeleton's hollow sockets. The visage of your dead companion has never remained for such a long period of time. You can see the simple traveling clothes of the Oathsworn that he wears and the scar on his forehead caused by a pit crawler you fought together long ago. He also sports the same wry smile he always wore in life. His presence begs a question.

    <string name="chp16_19_2__a">"The phantom before you has often been useful in moments of need, such as when he helped you find the Wire after fleeing Bastone. It is unclear what Samil's motive is here, but it seems to involve helping to keep you alive. Taking a chance, you ask him what happened here. 

\"A bargain was struck,\" Samil says matter of factly. A pregnant silence follows and an uneasiness envelops you. You had not expected him to speak and have never heard Samil talk before. A thousand questions come to mind, but before you can ask them he points off into the trees and vanishes."</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_3__a">"The phantom before you has often been useful in moments of need, such as when he helped you find the Wire after fleeing Bastone. Still, after all this time, you have no idea why you see this vision from your past. 

When you ask Samil, he offers you a mischievous smile. Or is it sadness? In life it had always been hard to tell with Samil. 

\"A bargain was struck,\" Samil says. A pregnant silence follows and an uneasiness envelops you. You had not expected him to speak and have never heard Samil talk before. A thousand questions come to mind, but before you can ask them he points off into the trees and vanishes."</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_4__a">"Looking to where Samil pointed, you can make out some large stones between the trees. Cautiously, you draw your weapons and advance in a defensive formation. In the eerie silence, you come to a clearing where you find nine standing stones, each of them bearing a heavy iron chain in which skeletons still hang. In the center of the clearing is a block of polished stone. The surrounding area looks as though a great battle had once been fought here. Broken branches and crushed stones are strewn about, yet the circle itself is untouched, seemingly immune to the destruction.

As you draw near to the stone circle. The air around you becomes charged and a metallic taste fills your mouth. Blood? 

\"Welcome Oathsworn,\" a disembodied voice echoes through the woods. It almost sounds like a chant, many people as one, with a singular determination. You ask whether you are talking to Samil, but a dismissive laugh tells you you are not. \"No, we are merely a benefactor, a means to your ends, we have something to offer you…\" If this is not Samil speaking again, then this must be Mycelle's patron. You level the accusation at the voice and it replies with relish, \"Mycelle, yes. We gave him what he wanted. To become eternal…\"

The word echoes around the stones. Suddenly, you hear a roar from somewhere far off in the Deepwood. Something approaches. 

\"It seems you do not have much time Oathsworn, What may we give you? We can give you anything you desire. However, unlike with Mycelle, we will also tell you what we will take.\" 

\"We can feel the rot within you,\" the voice says after a brief silence. \"We can ease your suffering, for a taste of your life. Or you may allow us to drink deep from one of those who travels with you. In return, we will bestow great power upon you.\"

You hear a roar thunder once again from within the Deepwood, closer than before. \"Decide quickly,\" the voice says, amused.

    <string name="chp16_19_7__a">Laughter echoes all around you. \"Not enough? Perhaps you crave something sweeter?\" asks the voice. \"There is much more we can offer you. Simply give us one of your own and we will give you true power. You will need it for what is coming.\"</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_8__a">\"Very well,\" the voice says. Suddenly, a sharp pain stabs your chest and it feels as though your blood is trying to leave your body.</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_8__c">As the pain fades, you hear faint laughter in the wind. \"How does this sliver of power taste?\" the voice asks. \"We can also give you true power. Simply give us one of your own. You will need our power for what is to come.\"</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_9__a">"Looking at your allies gathered just beyond earshot at the edge of the stone circle, you nod in assent. They will never know you forfeited their life, and from what you have seen here, you will need every advantage in what comes next. 

\"So be it,\" the voice says and you notice one of your allies is no longer there. Immediately, a feeling of power surges within you. You tell yourself the ends justify the means, and try to shake off the thought of where your ally just went."</string>
    <string name="chp16_19_9__c">A tense silence hangs over the Free Company. \"How does this sliver of power taste?\" the voice asks. \"We can also give you true power. Simply give us one of your own. You will need my power for what is to come.\"</string>
    <string name="chp16_1_1__a">Many Wires snake their way through the Deepwood to the entrance of Thrace. Following the one pointed out by the Sergeant, you eventually find the remnants of the destroyed caravan. Pieces of wagons, shattered crates and more than a few maimed corpses still litter the ground. Several Deepwood trees in the area are broken and snapped. No ordinary beast could have rendered this much damage. Whatever befell this caravan, it was massive. You may be able to discern what kind of beast it was by investigating the tracks it left behind.</string>
    <string name="chp16_1_2__a">Looking through the destroyed wagons, you find small bits of the men left behind. The rest has already been reclaimed by the Deepwood. The carts look as though something humongous was dropped on them, flattening them like coins, and the ground surrounding the area has deep impact craters. Luckily, you do manage to recover some of the goods the caravan had been transporting.</string>
    <string name="chp16_1_2__c">As you finish your search, you hear a faint sound coming from further within the Deepwood. It sounds like someone is sobbing nearby.</string>

As you finish your search, you hear a faint sound coming from deeper within the Deepwood. It sounds like someone is sobbing nearby."</string>
    <string name="chp16_1_4__a">You train your eyes on the blackness between the trees and follow the sound of the weeping. Listening closely, the sounds appear to be coming from a man, yet they are warped to a deeper tone. Pushing aside the branches blocking your view, you see a towering boulder obscured by the shadows ahead. As you move past it, the stone-like mass convulses and a twisted sob grumbles forth. Startled, you quickly raise a hand for your company to freeze. Your warning is immediately heeded, but the clattering of loose equipment betrays your presence as the clink of metal fills the air. The boulder suddenly unfurls, rising to stand as a hulking mass high above you. A human face, wracked by anguish, contorts and snarls from atop its massive shoulders as it charges toward you.</string>
    <string name="chp16_1_4__c">"You manage to land some quick blows, but the mounds of scabbed skin covering its body deflect your strikes. Pus oozes from the marks your weapons leave behind. The beast barrels straight through your group and continues off into the treeline. With a quick check of your compass, you follow the tracks it has left behind. The creature is fast and easily outpaces you with its massive stride. Luckily, the beast is easy to track. You pass tree after broken tree when suddenly the view opens and you find yourself standing at the edge of a deep ravine. The cliff is far too tall to climb down and you cannot see anything below but thick darkness. However, the tracks clearly led this way. Did the creature jump? How could it survive a fall like that?

With the trail now lost, you head back to the city and regroup. You can never truly understand a beast until you fight it. Much of what you have learned so far, however, you would rather forget. If your bruised ribs and cracked armor is any indication of what awaits you, this 'Ogre of Thrace' will not go down easily."</string>
    <string name="chp16_22_1__a">"22 - Unnamed House

Following the instructions on the map, you arrive at a nondescript house and immediately recognize the water drop symbol from the wax seal on the scroll casually displayed on one of the doors. As you approach the door, a small slit opens and a pair of inquisitive eyes looks you over. 

When you hold up the scroll, the door is opened and you are ushered into a house of darkness, lit by a single amber torch whose light fails to reach the walls. As the door is shut behind you, a woman emerges from the shadows wearing a plain mask concealing her face. An assassin's mask."</string>
    <string name="chp16_22_2__a">"\"Oathsworn. We've been expecting you. Please, sit,\" she begins. You suddenly notice a number of chairs arrayed behind you that were not there moments before. Looking back to the masked woman, you see a table and some wine being brought from the shadows by black clothed individuals and you begin to wonder how many more people are hidden in the shadows. The masked woman sits and proceeds to fill cups for everyone. Presumably as a sign of trust, she takes a sip of each cup before passing them over to you. Perhaps it is a customary gesture to show that you are not about to be poisoned? 

\"I'm sure you know why you are here,\" she continues. \"You've already dealt with one of our operatives, one you would know as Elanna.\" There is no emotion in her words, neither contempt nor relief, but you remain tense, ready for an ambush. The woman then signals into the darkness and a Faceless appears, naked from the waist up with brandings all over his back. 

\"This is the contract you successfully foiled,\" she says, gesturing to the Faceless. \"By right, you may now terminate the contract if you wish.\" As she turns the Faceless man around, you see the brandings carved into the flesh of his back are in fact the words of the contract itself. This man is literally a contract of flesh and blood. As you study the words, you can read the name of the King of Verum himself. He is the mark.

\"Kill the contract and our obligation will be at an end. If you choose not to, the contract lives on and will remain active.\" You can barely believe it, but it seems that the life of the King of Verum is endangered by the survival of this Faceless man.

You ask what exactly Elanna is tasked to do. \"Guild business, you yourself know the restraints of a contract, Oathsworn. Anyway, you will know soon enough I am sure.\"

    <string name="chp16_22_4__c">\"The contract is now terminated, as our code decrees,\" the masked woman proclaims. \"So it is written.\" From the shadows, you hear a dozen other voices echoing the phrase, \"It is written.\" The contract assassins of Thrace live under a set of rules and laws that all must abide by. Without the opportunity to ask further questions, you are led back out of the house.</string>
    <string name="chp16_22_5__a">You tell the masked woman that you will not execute an innocent man just because you are asked to do so. You are no butcher. The efficiency and diligence of the Assassins Guild of Thrace is legendary. Elanna committed months of careful work to infiltrate the ranks of your Free Company just to get close to the King. If they send another assassin, it will most likely take just as long or even longer. Enough time to prepare and warn the king.</string>

Strangely, the children show no emotion at the sight of their dead father, another clear sign that the man was anything but a caring parent to them. Taking the children from the home you wonder what you will do with them. However, at the first sign of sunlight they dive off into the crowd. You try to follow, but their small bodies weave through the mass of people much faster than you can. They are gone. You can only hope their fate will be better than what their father had planned for them.</string>

The Five may be subject to the laws of Verum, but you are a long way from home. Only a fool would think The Pact would save you from a family like the Pytones. Feeling the knots gather between your shoulder blades, you ask him what he wants.

\"You hunt monsters, do you not?\" he asks, clearly grinning behind his ornate mask. \"Well, I want the heart from the greatest of them all. The Ogre of Thrace.\""</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_13__c">"The Pytone tilts his head, studying you for a moment when you inquire about the aether. \"Oh, I am sorry, but that was not part of our deal. However, if you are prepared to perform one more task for me, I am sure I can oblige.\"

The power needed to shatter the warded dark iron collars is unfathomable. If she broke her collar again, and you did not have the drug, you could all be dead in moments. It is a risk you cannot afford to take, you need the aether. A slight narrowing of the Pytone's eyes tells you he is smiling as the realization dawns on you. You ask for the vials and you get the reply you knew was coming. \"I am sorry, Oathsworn, but that was not part of our deal.

    <string name="chp16_4_16__a">"\"The Ogre was last sighted two days ago attacking a caravan outside the city, the guards at the foregate could tell you where exactly. We have also come to understand that the beastmaster at the Coliseum claims to have seen the thing on one of his hunts.\" 

Without a reply, you turn away from the Thracian noble and make your way back into the City of Masks. Your hunt for the Ogre of Thrace has begun. One last job and you can go home, provided there is still a home to go to. A tingling sensation in your arm brings back images of Verum burning. The plague still courses through your veins and seems to grow stronger with each day. Hopefully, there is enough time to save Verum before it consumes you."</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_17__a">Returning to the crowded street, a Faceless boy rushes up to you and places a sealed scroll into your hand, then disappears into the sea of people. Looking at the wax seal, you notice the symbol of a water droplet centered within its border.</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_19a__a">"The Blade snatches up the scroll and studies it. The teardrop symbol is well known to those who call Thrace home. This is the insignia for the Assassins' Guild. They are known to lurk in the shadows even beyond the city walls and are the backbone of Thracian politics. They are also the only ones permitted to carry out assassinations. 

Reading the scroll, you learn that it is an invitation to meet at a specific location later in the day. It may be a trap, but if there was a price on your head, they surely would come for you unannounced."</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_20a__a">"Opening the scroll, you see an invitation which reads: 'Your presence is requested. There is business to discuss.' The note is unsigned, but it contains a map with notes directing you to the location of the meeting place."</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_2__a">After the debacle at the assembly, the city became much more tense. The Five are facing off against one another, just as Rubeo had wanted. You have seen nothing in the streets and life carries on as usual, but in the shadows you can hear the sounds of blades being sharpened. You know there is a witch to be gained here, but are out of options. Then a messenger comes to find you, sent by the head of the Amiese family. They come with an invitation to meet.</string>
    <string name="chp16_4_2__c">"The head of the Amiese stands before you, resplendent in the ornate mask of their house, but the eyes behind it are different. The Amiese you had known is gone, the first victim of the escalating conflict in the city.

    <string name="chp16_4_3__c">"The Pytone brings you into a large banquet hall where a throne sits upon a dais on the far side of the chamber. An unkempt woman in ragged noble clothing is chained to it, clearly your witch. As the masked one approaches the throne, the witch fights to lift her gaze, seemingly exhausted, or perhaps under the effects of some drug. Suddenly, the room starts to shake and you can clearly sense the immense power emanating from the woman. \"Ah, just in time,\" the Pytone says, taking a small vial from a satchel proffered by a nearby servant. Having moved behind the witch, one of the personal guards takes the chain leash into his hands and yanks down hard, pulling the woman to her knees. 

The Pytone then pours the contents of the vial down the witch's throat and clamps her mouth shut. \"Oh Aurelia. So sweet of you to try every time.\" The witch becomes subdued, staring vacantly into the distance. \"Aether,\" the nobleman says, shaking the satchel to produce the clink of vials. \"A powerful sedative, very difficult to acquire and extremely expensive,\" he says, with a smile. \"One needs to keep this witch under control. She has already broken her witch collar once. She took the lives of thirty guards before we could subdue her last time.\" Unlatching the chain from the throne, he drags the witch behind him and holds the chain out to you. \"She is yours now, Oathsworn, I do hope you have no problems with her.\"

I have a witch, a powerful one, but you will do something for me first.\" After everything that has happened, a part of you considers forcing the woman to give you the witch, but the sight of the dozen or so guards within striking distance sobers the thought. The Five may be subject to the laws of Verum, but you are a long way from home. Only a fool would think The Pact would save you from a family like the Amiese. Resigned, you ask what she wants.

The Oathmark on your wrists help you gain entrance into the catacombs underneath Thrace. Heading down the winding staircase, you come to an ancient tunnel adorned with busts of all the great Thracian families. Following the tunnel, you eventually come to a circular room with six doors, each adorned with the mask of a major family, except for one. This lone door has no sigil, but instead is marred by brutal gouges. By a process of elimination this must be the one you are looking for. At its center, between the gouges, you see a small circular device which appears to be a sequence lock consisting of two wheels, one rotating around the other. It would have taken a master artificer to create such a mechanism."</string>

    <string name="chp16_epi_3__a">"You remove the Ogre's heart as instructed, wrapping it securely in a cloth. Somehow, the organ still beats. Returning the coveted item to the masked noble, you are given the reward you were promised. The witch, Aurelia, along with the aether. Gathering her shackles, as well as the vials to keep her under control, you are once again warned of the danger she poses. You are assured that the supplied drugs will be enough to keep the witch under sedation until your task is complete."</string>

Until then, you are sworn to the task and there are still plenty of marches between Thrace and Verum.</string>
    <string name="chp16m_1_1__a">"This scroll, once sealed by a Scarab mark, seems to have been sent many years ago. It is unclear how this might pertain to the Ogre of Thrace, though it does appear to point toward some kind of secret history. 

The letter reads: 

'The Five continue to look down upon us, mistaking our restraint for a lack of conviction. Their arrogance will be our advantage. I have convinced my dearest Mycelle to pursue the means of teaching them the truth behind the Scaravelho words, 'Lindo mas venenoso'. Beautiful but deadly. They will learn that when they step on us, we bite back. Mycelle has been meeting with a patron deep in the woods. I fear for my husband. Still, Mycelle promises me this is the best way to return our family to glory. As with all letters, I entrust this to Anila of the Swan family. They are, and will forever be, our trusted advisors. Should you receive this letter from anyone else, consider it to have been intercepted. The Swans may live at the edge of the web, but they are a loyal part of us. I will write again as soon as possible.' 

This Swan family may have more letters or information pertaining to this, if they still exist. Though there is no guarantee this thread will lead you to the Ogre, any lead may be worth exploring."</string>
    <string name="chp16m_2_1__a">"The lettering here seems to have been written by the same author as the first, but the penmanship is more slanted and earnest. 

It reads:

'I came across a sketch of Mycelle's the other day. He took to the arts as a young child and wooed me during our courtship. See the picture he once drew of the Scarvelho estate, promising me one day that it would be mine. These months have weighed on him heavily, however, and he has lost his appetite for the arts. Or so I assumed, until I found a sketch of a ring with nine stones crowned by the moon. Its light was somehow unkind and menacing.

I must confess, he worries me. He does not sleep, and he hides his face behind a cowl. He refuses to bed me and does not say why. He angers easily when I question him, insisting our time will come. It has been five moons since he started this ordeal. I pushed him to save the Scaravelho name, but since his return from the woods, nothing but misery has followed. What else could one ever bring back from the Deepwood?'

Along with the letter is the drawing. It depicts a manor house in an area of Thrace you do not immediately recognize, yet somehow feels familiar. Then it clicks, the structure is different but the foundational shapes remain the same. The sketch seems to be of the Carnedine Grounds, but from an older era when the Scaravelho ruled it. At some point in the past the Scaravelho had been overthrown. In the background of the sketch there is a circular tower, atop which a woman stands, gazing up at an unkind moon.

Considering everything you have learned so far, you now know there was a sixth great family in Thrace once. One that has been erased from history. If this is true there may be more clues in the catacombs beneath the city where the great families keep their vaults."</string>
    <string name="chp16m_3_1__a">"The third entry is wrought with panic. Once elegant lettering is now jagged, written with such haste that the ink was smudged beneath the hand.

It reads:

'Mycelle's visits to the Deepwood have become more frequent, and though he brings back good news, it is what he leaves behind that concerns me most. The first month he took with him a frail Faceless shoemaker. The second, he took a crying crone too frail to even stir a pot. On the third, he took a cripple in the twilight of his life, and on the fourth, a mute in his noon. It has now been nine months. The Faceless never return, but such losses do not worry me. They are breakable iron. But each time Mycelle returns to Thrace, he is less of a man. It is as though I see a ghost wandering our halls. I beg him to tell me what our patron is offering him in the Deepwood, but Mycelle merely insists that it will take time. All the while, the Volpe and the Carnedine hover like vultures. I cannot help but feel an end is rushing to meet us, either by dog's teeth or fox's claws. Or perhaps something else.'

This Mycelle seems to have been the leader of the lost house, but something happened to him. Whatever it was, it has led to the downfall and erasure of his house."</string>
    <string name="chp16m_4_1__a">"This fourth account is incomplete. Its lettering is frantic, scraped and angular. Ink blotches spot the page and are smeared like blood. 

It reads:

'The Volpe and Carnedine have grown to fear Mycelle and so have I. He now claims he is eternal, that he cannot die and spends much time in the woods. I can sense the other Five preparing to swoop in and deal with us. In a way, I pray they do. Mycelle has changed. Great scabs cover his body and he is more beast now than man. Bloated and vengeful. Power he has, but at what cost? He killed Enaro in the tower yesterday and there are so few of us left, even I am not safe from his wrath. Whatever our patron offered him, whoever it is, they have taken more from us, more than they ever gave. I wish he had never found that stone circle to the east. History will say it was his folly, but it was always mine, I should not have driven him to it. I leave these words as testament to my mistakes…' 

Is it possible this Mycelle is the Ogre of Thrace? Some transformed man. If it were true he would be ancient, the last remains of a noble family long scoured from the city. The letter had mentioned a stone circle to the east, something tells you that is where you will find your target."</string>
    <string name="chp17_15_1__a">The cold rain is relentless with the buffeting winds resisting each step you take. As the land begins to rise at an incline, you sense you have reached the foothills of the mountain range near Refuge. Once you have cleared this hurdle, you should be able to reacquire the Wire Road. Suddenly, you feel a vibration rumble beneath your feet and the world around you begins to change. Birds flee from the shelter of the boughs high above as a brutish shape bursts from the darkness ahead, snapping fat branches like twigs and pounding the earth. An Ocarro, one of the few herbivores able to survive the Deepwood, charges toward you in a heavy gallop. The beast is larger than a cart and horse and is covered in bony plates of armor. Each toe on its boulder-sized feet is armed with a single scythe-like nail that gouges the earth with each stride. Not far behind, the rest of the Ocarro herd crashes through the Deepwood, crushing plants and stones alike. They are clearly fleeing the storm ravaging the area and rarely attack humans, however, that hardly matters when you are standing directly in the path of the stampede.</string>
    <string name="chp17_15_1__c">You manage to dive aside, narrowly avoiding being impaled by the spear-like toes of one behemoth as the avalanche of armored meat and muscle plows through the forest and rumbles off to the east, in the direction opposite the village. With the crisis averted, you gather up your strewn equipment and continue on toward the village of Refuge.</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_1__a">"You have done as ordered and now have the witch you needed for The Keening. The woman, still under the effects of the aether, is lethargic and slow, with only enough strength to walk when assisted. Her face is caked in dirt. The Thracians have not treated her well. Probably too afraid to get close to her. Looking at the woman, you remind yourself you are looking at a person, not a target.

    <string name="chp17_1_2__c">Gently helping the woman to her feet, you explain that you are following the orders of the king and have no choice in the matter. With the Oath comes many burdens and this is a heavy one. Though you may not be able to free her, you can try to keep her comfortable. Dampening a cloth with water, you wash the dirt from her face and offer her some food.</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_3__c">The job is a hard one but the facts are simple. Without this woman the city of Verum will fall and thousands of civilians will die. You know you signed up for this when you took the Oath. To be the one who makes the hard choices. Getting the woman to her feet, you lead her outside.</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_4__c">"You have a job to do and dwelling on the situation won't make things any easier. There are no guarantees you will survive long enough to reach the Heart of Darkness to perform your fell task. You have accomplished your purpose here in Thrace, and that is all that matters. Taking one step at a time keeps you focused and alive. Helping the woman to her feet, you lead her outside."</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_5__a">"At last, the time has come to leave Thrace. You have endured enough Thracian politicking, and lingered in the shadow of an oppressive slave system long enough for your liking. With a lengthy journey ahead, you make for the Tradesman's district to stock up on last minute supplies."</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_5__c">With Thrace at your back, you plunge into the Deepwood once again. The scorching sun rising over the city behind you is blotted out by the thick forest canopy in a matter of moments, enshrouding you in a murky twilight. The sounds of cracking whips and merchants bartering soon fade away, only to be replaced by the eerie silence of the woods. With one hand on your blade, and the other on the Wire Road, you march into darkness.</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_6__a">The first few days pass with only one instance of note.</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_6__c">"At dawn on the fifth day of your journey, you reach the broken end of the Wire Road not far from Refuge, the infamous village you had been held captive in just a few weeks ago. The thought of the Wandering Queen's eyes still haunts your nightmares. As you walk you reach the end of the wire, still broken from your previous visit. Thankfully, you know the village to be west beyond a mountain range and, with the use of your Free Company's compass, you should be able to find the village and then the Wire Road once more. Removing your compass from your backpack you check your heading. Turning to face west, you let your hand fall from the Wire Road and plunge into the treeline toward Refuge.

After a short while, a high wind rises, stirring chaos in the boughs above. The air is electrified with static and your ears pop with the shift in air pressure. What little sky you can see through the canopy is quickly darkening. A storm is brewing. As the swirling winds kick up dirt and loose branches, you check your heading once more. Then you pause. The compass is spinning."</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_7__a">"The secrets of a compass's mechanisms are carefully guarded by the Watchers but though you are not privy to its inner workings, you do remember seeing a Banksmith demonstrate the effect a strange metallic rock can have on them, leading the needle to point wherever the rock was positioned. A needle spinning out of control, however, is nothing you have ever seen. Whenever things cease to make sense, one is always led to the same conclusion… witchcraft. You first check to make sure it is not your prisoner creating the phenomenon and find her still safely under the effects of the aether. There must be something else causing this. As the air begins to vibrate with energy, you realize something is very wrong."</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_8__c">"The secrets of a compass's mechanisms are carefully guarded by the Watchers and ones you are not privy to despite the mark on your wrist. The compass has never led you astray before, however, there is no way to determine your heading with the needle spinning out of control. As the air begins to vibrate with energy, you realize something is very wrong."</string>
    <string name="chp17_1_9__a">"Fat raindrops begin to pelt you from the sky as the needle continues to spin, now more erratically. The storm rages around you in full force as the howling winds lash at cloaks. You can barely see an inch in front of your face as tree branches whip wildly through the air. In all your time in this Free Company, you have never experienced a storm as powerful as this. There seems to be an angry, oppressive force behind the weather, giving it a life of its own. 

In circumstances such as this, you are trained to find shelter and wait it out, but with the captive witch in your company there is much at stake in a delay. There is also no telling if the compass will return to normal. You know the mountain range adjacent to Refuge is just to the west. If you can reach it, you can either cut through or circle around to reach the village and find the Wire Road again. However, if you press on without knowing your bearings, and head in the wrong direction you could easily find yourself lost forever within these woods. You take your life into your hands in both staying and going. So, as you have done many times before, you decide to take action."</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_10a__a">Resting your weary bones by the fire, you wring a pool of rainwater from your clothing. The heat from the fire relaxes you, and for a moment you forget the howling wind waiting for you outside.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_10a__c">"After a time you stand. You cannot stay here, you feel the Blood Fiend off in 'the other place'. It will come again soon.

With a final glance at the fire, you head back out into the rain.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_15__a">"You know that the best chance of survival they have is for you to succeed in defeating whatever is conjuring the storm over Refuge. In order to do that, you need to be well-supplied.

Towering over the ill-fed peasants, you grab one by the scruff of the neck and hold him above the small fire. In no uncertain terms, you order them to hand over their supplies.

In a sudden change of heart, they acquiesce."</string>

    <string name="chp17_22_1__c">The fetid rocks and roots of the Deepwood eventually give way to an ancient city, collapsed into ruin. You had learned of the existence of this forgotten city during your time in Refuge. A fell place whose inhabitants worshiped the Wandering Queen. Thankfully, this cursed city is now condemned to history, but as you walk the empty streets of worn stone, you keep a hand near your weapon, ready for anything that may attempt to ambush you. Ruins such as these often become lairs for the creatures that stalk shadows. Moving with careful coordination, you cover the corners of alleyways and buildings, always maintaining a tight formation as you navigate the narrow streets.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_2__a">Slowly making your way down an alley flanked by high walls, you sense movement and hear the slight scrape of a boot on stone. Before you have a chance to turn, an avalanche of rock falls upon you.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_2__c">"Fist-sized rocks and small boulders rain down from above. Diving to the side, you raise your pack above your head and succeed in deflecting away the worst of the avalanche. A cry of surprise echoes from above as your assailant realizes the trap failed to kill you. Jumping to your feet, your group moves as one into the nearby building to converge on your target. 

Climbing to the top floor, you find a group of humans fearfully huddled against the far wall of a room with daggers and bows trained on the doorway. You see the panic in their eyes as they realize they missed the only shot they had to end you. One of the attackers looses an arrow that ricochets off the edge of your waiting blade and pings harmlessly off the wall. You are in no mood for this. As you advance into the room, the rest drop their weapons and raise their hands in submission. Once you get a clearer look at them, you realize these must be survivors from Refuge, perhaps a hunting party that was not present during your purge of the village. They must have fled your wrath and hidden here.

You can tell these people recognize who you are and are very aware of what you did to their village. No doubt they believed they could exact their revenge upon you and loot your corpses for supplies. With their plot foiled, however, they have thrown themselves at your mercy. 

Before deciding how to deal with the assailants, you ask them if they know what is happening in Refuge. The eldest of them hesitantly offers a reply. \"We… we returned from a hunt and everyone was dead. The village was dead. After gathering what supplies we could find, we started to leave, but something was there. Something malefic. The One as my witness, it was a blood twister. We never saw it but we know what it did to Borik. He lost control of himself as all his bones twisted, breaking them into splinters. Then, spears of blood went right through Gorlan. The rest of us… we ran. Straight into the woods until we got here. That's when this storm set in.\""</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_2__e">"Getting some idea of what awaits you is helpful, but as lightning arcs overhead, you know you need to make a decision. These men have broken The Pact and attempted to take the life of an Oathsworn. Judgement is yours to render.

    <string name="chp17_22_3__a">"Slowly making your way down an alley flanked by high walls, you sense movement and hear the slight scrape of a boot on stone. Plunging your arm into an open window you drag a shocked, dirty villager into the light. \"Please, Oathsworn!\" he begs. \"We mean no harm!\" 

Hauling the man to his feet, you watch as a handful of other villagers appear from the darkness with their hands raised. Once you get a clear look at them, you realize these must be survivors from Refuge. Somehow they escaped the devastation and sought shelter here. You lower your weapons as the survivors approach and they invite you to join them inside their makeshift home. 

You find more survivors huddled together by a small amber fire in the middle of a stone room. With a welcomed reprieve from the torrential rain, you ask if they know what is happening in Refuge. The eldest of them offers a reply. \"We… we returned from a hunt and everyone was dead. The village was dead. After gathering what supplies we could find, we started to leave, but something was there. Something malefic. The One as my witness, it was a blood twister.

    <string name="chp17_22_3__c">"Looking at their tired, frightened faces, you doubt these people will survive long. Running only gets you so far in the Deepwood and fear has them all but paralyzed. None of them would fare well in a fight. 

Across the room, you see a pile of supplies. They seem to have found a few things of worth in the ruins and have also taken what looks like some Maiden Blossom from Nydia's stores. Maiden Blossom is known to be a powerful pain reliever. With the numerous injuries you have endured from your travels, the herb could be of some use to you. As you eye their stash, some of the men move to block your view. 

\"We have nothing to offer you, Oathsworn,\" one man pipes up. \"We don't even have enough for ourselves, and things are getting more and more desperate by the day.\"

    <string name="chp17_22_4__a">Your justice comes harsh and swift. You have already decreed the village would be purged along with all who were complicit in its crimes. You had no choice but to complete the judgement. Leaving the bodies to rot where they fall, you uncover some artifacts the men had salvaged from the ancient ruins.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_4__c">Feeling the Blood Fiend some way off, you do not want to spend another moment in the shadows of this place. Getting your bearings once more you make to leave the dead city.</string>
    <string name="chp17_22_5__a">You tell the frightened villagers that judgement against their village is complete and they are free to go. Relief washes over the huddled survivors. Perhaps they escaped your purge for a reason. Or perhaps you are just getting soft. Either way, you have no desire to spend any more time in this dead city. As you turn to leave, you notice a pile of supplies stacked against an inner wall. Amongst them is a pouch of Maiden Blossom, a powerful pain reliever. Leaving the rest for the survivors, you requisition the herbs. If you are going to survive whatever awaits you in Refuge, you will need every bit of strength you have at your disposal.</string>

One of the villagers lashes out in anger, brandishing a dagger he had concealed in his flax sleeves. You effortlessly cut the man's hand off at the wrist and level your weapon at him. The man screams in pain as he sinks to his knees, cradling the stump. The others cautiously take a step back, raising their arms in submission. You proceed to take what you need from the supply stash before heading back out into the storm."</string>
    <string name="chp17_36_1__a">As the Deepwood floor begins to incline more steeply, you spot a break in the tree line to the West and catch a glimpse of the great, gray outline of a mountain range jutting from the earth. Examining the map you found in Refuge, you can see the village lies on the far side of those mountains. But you will need to decide whether to head south and skirt around the Southern tip of the range or to head North and find a way through them.</string>
    <string name="chp17_38_10__a">You land hard on the branch you were aiming for. With the wind nearly knocked out of you, you grip the limb as white foam thunders below. Not everyone has been so lucky though. A cry pierces the downpour and you turn just in time to see the shape of one of your allies disappear beneath the water. Earnestly, you scan the water for any sign of them and shout downstream, but the only reply you receive is the sound of crashing waves. Another death at the end of a single decision. Your decision. Dragging yourself back to level ground, you get ready to move out.</string>
    <string name="chp17_38_11__a">"You land hard on the branch you were aiming for. With the wind nearly knocked out of you, you grip the limb as white foam thunders below.

Dragging yourself back to level ground, you get ready to move out."</string>
    <string name="chp17_38_1__a">Up ahead you hear the sound of rushing water. As the trees open up, you can see an ancient river bed flowing down from the mountains to the West. What had once been dried up for a thousand years is now a surging mass of water and debris some twenty paces across. As the rain batters your face, you weigh your options.</string>
    <string name="chp17_38_2__a">"Looking at the churning water, you realize that your choices are limited. You can go over or through. Wood floats, and with a few branches and linked arms, you might be able to stay together long enough to swim to the other side. On the other hand, the trees swaying in the wind above the river pass close enough to each other for you to attempt to jump between branches in the canopy. The rain coats everything and there is no telling if the branches will hold, but it provides a potentially drier path. Neither option sounds good to you, but the worst would be to try and go back toward the Blood Fiend.

Stepping gingerly out on a limb crossing the churning water below, you grab other branches to stabilize yourself. Before you is a leap of faith, a distance the height of a man where no support can be found. The branch on the far tree sways in the high winds and timing your leap, you jump.</string>

Crashing between you, it breaks the link between you and your companion next to you. You and the rest of the group go one way, your companion goes the other. You cry out after them, but they disappear beneath the waves.

Looking back across the line, you see the far bank closing in. With monumental effort, you float, swim and pull your way to the welcome mud on the other side. As you crawl out of the rapids, you gaze back to where your companion had been. Another death decided in a single moment of weakness. Your weakness. Dragging yourself back to your feet, you ready yourself to move out."</string>
    <string name="chp17_38_9__a">Your head plunges underwater and your arm slips from the one next to you. For a moment, you are surrounded by rushing water on all sides, unable to discern up from down. Then a hand grips your pack and hauls you back to the surface. Gasping for air you relink arms and see the far bank closing in. With a monumental effort, you float, swim and pull your way to the welcome mud on the other side. Taking a head count, you find everyone is still with you.</string>
    <string name="chp17_40_1__a">"Through the howling wind and driving rain, you press onward. Tree limbs lash at your face and mud slips beneath your boots. Thunder rumbles overhead and the only illumination is from stark jolts of white lightning that crash around you. You are at your limit when the blood rain begins again. Something is different this time though. As the storm continues, you are not in 'the other place', you find you are still in the real world. This is a bad omen. Emerging from the trees behind you, the Blood Fiend strides. The fiend is here, in the real world! Somehow it has clawed its way into reality, there is no veil between you now. It has become more powerful, larger, as if drawing strength from the storm itself.

You are exhausted, but you know you have only one option. You break formation and run."</string>
    <string name="chp17_40_1__c">"Past tree after tree you charge, the Blood Fiend hot on your heels. It shows no sign of tiring, all you have done is bought yourself time. Suddenly, the treeline appears and you burst into a familiar circle of clear ground. You have reached Refuge, the eye of the storm. Turning, you see the Blood Fiend advance behind you. It raises a thick claw made from rolling droplets of blood and swings it toward your face. Then the Blood Fiend collapses as its form crosses the edge of the clearing. Whatever malefice animates the thing ceases, and thousands of droplets of blood fall to the ground, forming just another pool of blood. You blink in shock, it seems the fiend had been a product of the storm or whoever wields it. Bound under its shadow, here at the eye of the storm, it lost its grip on reality. 

You are not out of the woods yet. Turning back to the village, you see the sight of swirling shadows and blood whirling in a vortex around the structure in the heart of Refuge. The storm's source. Drawing weapons you stalk toward the center. 

Keeping clear of any line of sight, you press your backs to one of the many wooden houses gathered around the village's heart. The last time you were here an ancient spider queen tried to eat you. Now you have to deal with a blood storm. If you survive this, you vow to yourself to burn this place to the ground and rid the world of its taint once and for all.

You begin to signal a flanking maneuver when a voice emerges from the vortex. \"Come marked ones, he awaits.\" Whoever is responsible for the storm knows who you are. They know you are here. With the element of surprise lost, you emerge from the shadow of the building to an unholy sight. 

Hundreds of corpses lay in concentric circles all facing inward. As you look on in horror, you see the blood draining from them in a red mist, curling through the air to be deposited inside an abomination. The resurrected corpse of the Scar Tribe Chieftain. Horribly disfigured, his bloated proportions are twisted and corrupted. One of his arms has been warped into a single great claw and boney spikes jut from his back. You realize that what you are seeing resembles the Blood Fiend that had been stalking you through the storm. Had it been the Chieftain that hunted you? A red glow lights his eyes and behind him you can see the Shaman you battled in the Scar Tribe village. Somehow she had survived the conflagration, brought the Chieftain's body here and now, using the blood of an entire village, had brought back this creature from the dead. You have no idea how it was done, but you do know why. Revenge… the sensation had permeated every encounter with the Blood Fiend. The Shaman had followed you, known you would return through Refuge and laid her trap. The storm, 'the other place', this abomination, all an embodiment of one unfulfilled desire to finish what was started. To see you dead. 

The Chieftain roars, and from the corner of your eyes you see the shadows of the corpses elongate. Hands and the shapes of mouths, stretch out around the Shaman and the Chieftain, ignoring them to seek you out. Even the shadows bend to the Shaman's will. It will take fire and fury to finish this task. Sparking amber torches you roar your own battle cry."</string>
    <string name="chp17_45_1__a">"The Deepwood gives way to hard rock and you ascend the mountain, climbing hand over hand across boulders. The wind whips around you and the rain threatens your grip, yet you push on. After a time, the treetops fall away and you are left with the mountain and the roiling storm. Eventually, you reach the summit and gain a clear view of the nexus of swirling clouds that is the hurricane. Lightning arcs illuminate a vortex above you, and you are struck by a sense of your own smallness in the face of such awesome power. 

To your surprise, you are not alone on the summit. Drawing your eyes away from the storm you can make out a solitary cloaked figure standing, arms outstretched toward the nexus. The figure is tall and carries an elegantly crafted blade on his back, longer than any you have ever seen. Advancing cautiously, you ask the man a question.

Rushing to its edge, you look down and see nothing but a deadly drop below. At least, deadly for any human. You did not get a sense the figure was responsible for the storm, but seemed instead to be drinking from it somehow? Lightning arcing overhead snaps you from your reverie. You have no time to wonder where the figure went. You need to focus on where you are going."</string>

    <string name="chp17_61_4__a">"A bolt of lightning bursts above your head. Crackling electricity cascades around an invisible dome proceeding from your witch's outstretched hands and flows safely into the ground. Sweat glistens on your witch's forehead as she clenches her hands in pain. Such control of the elements is an awesome sight, but it has drained her. Nethertheless, she certainly saved your life in that moment.

Looking at your witch, you see her hands clenched in pain. Whatever she tried to do hurt her as well, and may just have saved your life.

There is no Deepwood here to block your view, but still the rain and darkness of the storm hamper visibility. Then, through a flash of lightning, you see it. The mouth of a cave. Could this be a tunnel to the far side?

Sparking an amber torch, you inspect the opening. You hear no danger within and see no telltale glints of light moving in the darkness watching you. Frozen and soaked through, you head in. 

Almost immediately, a silence falls over you. A welcome quiet, devoid of howling and broken only by the rhythmic sound of your footsteps. As you had hoped, the cave becomes a tunnel and continues to stretch toward the West. You may finally be having some good fortune for a change."</string>
    <string name="chp17_64_2__a">"Continuing by amber light you forge on, now sure this will lead you out on the far side of the mountain. As you draw closer however, the walls of the tunnel change. Gray rock gives way to silken threads and you hear skittering coming from side passages. 

Raising your weapons, you proceed cautiously into an open space covered in webs and lit on the far side by the distant light of the cave's exit. You know what this is, it is the lair of the Wandering Queen. She is dead thanks to you, but looking up, you see the reflection of dozens of eyes staring back. You failed to kill all her young that day, and they have been hiding here ever since. You bark to take up a defensive stance, at the same moment the spiders fall on you."</string>

The driving rain whips your face, you have to lean into the wind to make any headway. With visibility at only a few yards, you miss the fact the trees have given way to a fetid swamp. Looking down, you see the thick fluid churn around you. Beneath the surface you see great tubular shapes rolling over one another, giant leeches. You can feel them moving around your leg, you stab down into the mud only to bring your weapon up red with blood. Soon it will be your blood mixing with the mud if the leeches get a hold of you.</string>

Shouting for the rest of your Free Company to take cover in the trees, you grip the slick black bark of the nearest limb and climb. 

You make it only a dozen spans up the tree before the water hits. Rolling down from the mountains, a torrential wall of liquid, rock and mud crashes into you.

Making sure they can never rise again, you burn all the bodies along with the remains of Refuge, drying yourself by the purifying flames. The village is finally being laid to rest.

The nature of the storm changes. The wind dies down and for a moment the rain slows. You wonder if your fortunes are changing and then it begins to rain blood. Your vision blurs and the world upends. You steady yourself, trying not to throw up. The sky above you is warped and twisted by angry clouds and the air is a red mist. You believe you are in the same spot you were a moment ago, but are now somewhere else. The same Deepwood is still there, but changed. Different somehow. You have experienced hallucinations before, and this feels a lot like them. Your last shred of doubt that this storm is not malefic in nature evaporates as hot, sticky lifeblood falls from the sky, and the red mist gathers, coagulating before you into something horrific."</string>

The massive ornate tent is not hard to find, and upon entering you are faced with a group of captains hunched around a table with a large leather map. All are huddled at one end of the table with the other end being manned by a single figure, a Watcher. Clad in a deep black cloak, its face hidden within the shadow of its cowl, the Watcher's visage is off-putting at best. You can understand why the captains chose to give the creature a wide berth. 

With a salute from the assembled captains you approach the table and study the map. You have never seen such a complete map before. There is Verum, Cistercia, Thrace… Bastone now lies in ruins… as well as several other cities you have never visited, including Anvar and a massive city marked only with an X.

For the next half a bell you discuss the plan. Your destination is Raven's Reach, an ancient fortress that is within striking distance of the Heart of Darkness. It is your best hope for performing The Keening while mounting a resistance against the Deepwood. Should all go to plan, the innumerable creatures that you witnessed circling the Heart of Darkness will be drawn to Raven's Reach, allowing the survivors to gain entry, and find the cure for the plague. The A'Dendri had not said what form the cure would take, but they were certain the solution lies within the cave.

Raven's Reach is many days' march from Verum but taking the Wire Road will get you at least some of the way. After that you will be relying on a compass and known landmarks. It appears halfway between the end of the Wire and Raven's Reach lies an old Free Company waystation known as the Salt Tower. It is defensible and has stood the test of time, it will be a good place to end the first leg of your journey. From there, it is on to Raven's Reach. 

As you trace the path with your finger, you come to the massive city marked with an X on the map. It had a name once, but it has since been burnt out. \"We could travel through the city, to cut down our travel time,\" one captain suggests. 

\"Do not enter the city,\" a rasping voice utters, emanating from within the Watcher's cowl. All eyes turn to the black figure. \"It is… forbidden.\"

You know better than to question a Watcher. Whatever its reasons, its tone demands submission, a command which all assembled are only too ready to acquiesce to. It seems you will be going the long way around the city. 

The briefing continues for a short time, then as the briefing ends, you can feel the Watcher's eyes linger on you and the black spots on your arms. \"Your affliction grows,\" it rasps. With these words, it produces a bottle of a greenish liquid, similar to the one that healed you earlier. \"Paracea. To give you more time.\" The last time you had been given the concoction you had been told it was the only one, it seems that had not been entirely true. You say as much to the Watcher and its reply sends a shiver down your spine. \"Had you failed to retrieve the witch, it would have been true.\" Apparently you are still useful enough to keep alive. 

As you leave the tent, one of your captains approaches you. \"My lord, I couldn't avoid overhearing. You got an antidote for the plague. I would not ask, but it's my daughters, you see. They have been afflicted. They are hidden and do not have much time. What you hold could save them. I know it is much to ask, but would you allow me to give it to them?

Children cry as they desperately cling to the arms of the soldiers marching out, and both men and women shout encouragement to the soldiers passing by. 

Reaching the great bridges that span the dried up river bed that divides north from south, you see a new crowd arrayed before you, the infected. Hundreds deep and shambling on the far side of the river. As you had planned, the barricades are moved aside and a small squad armed with amber bombs charges through the gap and starts to lay down a tunnel of fire through the plague districts toward the King's gate.

The fire will not last long, so the procession moves at a double march through the tunnel of fire, eventually reaching Verum's great gates."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_19__c">"Beyond the gate, your army forms up as best as it is able, crowding around the walls. Many of these men and women have never been in the Deepwood before, and it looms with an ever-present darkness that chills the air until their breath can fog midday. You are used to it, but some of the soldiers touch the wall behind them with a hand, tentative to let go, lest they become lost.

The only way to get this army forward is to lead. Without pause you march into the Deepwood at the head of a column. You do not look back, confident that the soldiers will follow. Judging by the sound, they do. 

Traveling the Wire Road in such numbers is fraught with danger and it is not long before smaller attacks begin happening along the line. The things the soldiers are seeing terrify them but they fight them back with spear lines and arrows. In the hopes of keeping the army's spirits up, one bannerman begins a marching song, and the tune is quickly picked up by some surrounding squads eager for a distraction from what lurks in the trees. It is here that you are faced with your first command decision. You know that the song could lift the spirits of the soldiers, but at the same time it will draw any creatures nearby.

    <string name="chp18_1_1__a">"After the ordeal that was the blood maelstrom, you return to Verum, weary from the long road back. With the north end of the city completely ravaged by the plague, you find the King's Gate has been barred shut and entrance into Verum is now only permitted from the southern walls. A well defended series of switchback staircases and hastily assembled ladders offer the only means of scaling the city's towering palisades."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_1__c">"You enter the city and are immediately greeted by a delegation of the Inquisition. The Head Inquisitor, accompanied by two wardens, seizes the witch, Aurelia, that you have dragged from Thrace. 

\"Thank you, Oathsworn,\" the Inquisitor offers as he motions toward the witch. \"We'll see to her care until the call to muster in the morning. I would suggest you get whatever rest you can.\"

As night falls, you make your way toward the army camp situated in front of the Palace. Every muscle in your body shakes from exhaustion as you navigate through the press of humanity collected in this small area of the city. Looking down at your hands, you can feel the plague writhing inside you, growing stronger with each new day."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_20__a">You are surprised to see only three witches. Lyceen, the witch you had saved from Bastone, and later offered up for The Keening is missing. As you inquire about her, you learn that she never made it to Black Rock. By all accounts she vanished and no one knows why. One Inquisitor suggests she may have been rescued by someone. Who that could be, you cannot fathom.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_21__a">"With the briefing over, you have one more task to perform. Moving to where the wagons are being prepared, you take stock of the inventory. Some of the wagons have already been loaded, but you are asked to bring in your expertise for the rest. Supplies will be important, required to last until Raven's Reach. The Raven Spire has also thrown in a number of amber bombs that may be taken to aid in repelling assaults from the Deepwood. Finally, on a journey such as this, morale will be an issue, so bringing some barrels of ale could help later down the line. As the commanders of the army, the final decision on the loadout is up to you."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_21__c">With the wagons set and the army arranged behind you, it is finally time to move out.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_22__a">You give the man the antidote meant for you. You know that you can handle the plague for now and you are still not spreading it to others. The man weeps as you hand it to him and he thanks you. You request the man not tell anyone about the cure to avoid dissent among the troops, and yet word about your generosity spreads quickly, though no-one knows what exactly you did.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_23__a">"You know it is harsh, but your life is more important than this man's daughters. You deny him and take the Paracea for yourself."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_23__c">"You are concerned that by his own admission he hides plague victims inside of the quarantine zone. On the one hand you cannot risk the plague breaking out here as well, but on the other hand, the man would need to be interrogated which may cause dissent among the troops.

    <string name="chp18_1_24__a">"You only have to say the word, and the man is arrested. He knows what this is about and you can see him pleading for his daughters. You know what will happen to them, and can only imagine what will happen to him. You also know that seeing a captain dragged away so shortly before departure does not bolster the troops' confidence."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_24__c">You know you made the right choice, even though others may not. Once you leave, if the plague spreads too quickly in Verum, then nothing you do will matter and the city will fall. That cannot be risked.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_25__a">You decide not to turn the man in. You know they will perish soon anyway and arresting a captain before departure is a bad idea.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_26__a">"It all makes sense now. The reward you got from the guild in Thrace. You helped Elanna get close to the King, to spy on his defenses, to make her plan. You took the money the Guild offered and now the King is dead. 

There is nothing you can do to change what happened, but you still have the reward. Looking at your backpack and iron pouch you consider what to do with the blood money. Can you keep it, knowing what it cost?

    <string name="chp18_1_27__a">"As you drink, you force your mind back to the present. The muster is tomorrow and you know the time is here, the crusade into the Deepwood has come, the path to the Heart of Darkness and The Keening. 

There is nothing you can do to bring back the King, and you must lead the army tomorrow. With a hot meal inside you and with Bram drying your travel gear by an amber fire, you retire for the night."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_28__c">The iron feels tainted by the blood of the young King. Hefting the pouch, you give the iron to Greycane and ask him to see that it is used to help the city. Giving it away lets you breathe a little easier but you still feel the need to wash your hands afterward. Looking down, you imagine them covered in crimson.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_29__a">You tell yourself you had not knowingly aided the Assassins, and that giving the iron away now would serve no purpose other than to weaken you and your mission. Still, your rationale rings hollow and the iron feels heavy in your hand.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_2__a">"Even though you saved all who were inside, The Broken Oak succumbed to the fire after the plague hit. The half-charred tavern sign now swings on a post outside an army tent set up on the square before the palace. The building is gone, but the spirit is still there, and seeing it feels like coming home once again. Greycane, Midge and Bram beam as you enter the tent and patrons cheer at the sight of your return. The greeting comes with great expectations as you can feel the weight of the city's hopes being placed squarely on your shoulders. Bram brings you a drink and you are relieved to have made it back as you unsling your packs and fall into your seats.

    <string name="chp18_1_31__a">"Midge is excited and runs over to the young boy you found in Bastone. The orphan has not found his voice yet, but you have seen him coming into his own under the care of Greycane, Midge and Bram. Midge kneels down before the boy and tells him of the news that he will travel with the army. Then, to Midge's surprise the boy starts to cry. Midge is confused and tries to console him. He tells him of the importance of the mission and his part in it. The boy tries to signal something in Knock, but is too upset to gesture. Midge continues to talk about the mission, when suddenly the boy blurts out, \"Stay.\" His first word in a long time. Everyone in the tent is enthralled by the scene. Midge throws his arms around the boy and after finding his own voice again says, \"Don't worry little man, I promise you, I will come back.\" 

When he rejoins you, you tell him he best not make promises he may not be able to keep."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_32__a">"He rejoices at the news and begins to swing his sword in wild practice swings. Greycane raises a hand. \"Whoa, save it for the monsters lad, you're going to cut us a new window, swinging it like that.\" Sheepishly, Midge sheathes his sword, and with a smile, runs outside."</string>

You consider whether to keep him in your Free Company or release him of his debt and encourage him to stay with his family.

A few trembling hands tell you they may have benefited from a boost in morale, but they are soldiers of Verum, they will do their job and there is no more time for speeches. At the rear of the muster, final preparations are beginning on the wagons and it is only a matter of time before you push toward the King's Gate. Having seen the army, you prepare to talk to the captains."</string>

    <string name="chp18_1_39__a">"You wake up to the sound of the clanking of metal on metal, armor being fastened, and wagons being loaded. The muster outside is starting. You were told the army will consist of three-hundred soldiers of Verum, the largest crusade sent out into the Deepwood for quite some time. Most of the soldiers have never been outside of the city walls and the powers that be look to you, the 'Heroes of Bastone', to lead them. Today you will take three-hundred souls into the green, knowing none are likely to return. You have no choice however, the plague is at the door and Verum cannot hold on much longer. It falls to you to keep morale high enough to hold the army together until you reach the Heart of Darkness."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_39__c">"You emerge from your section of the tent into what is now the 'tap room' of the third iteration of The Broken Oak. There you see Midge waiting for you, a helmet on his head and a short sword at his side. He looks up at you, his ever-present smirk crooking up one side of his mouth. \"I'm ready,\" he says hopefully. \"Now before you say anything, hear me out. Here's three reasons you should let me come. One, you're going to need all the hands you can get. Two, I've been in the green before, and survived I might add. Three, Greycane has been teaching me to knife fight. And four, I need to help, need to make a difference.\" You tell him that is four reasons and he simply replies, \"All the more reason to let me come.\"

You had thought he would remain behind with Greycane and Bram, but the determination on Midge's face makes his opinion on that course of action clear.

You find the tent your companions have taken up as the site of the new Broken Oak. Nothing remains of the old but the tavern's half-charred sign and its remaining patrons. Greycane, Midge and Bram beam as you enter the tent, any lingering feelings about your abandonment North of the river have been set aside as you see hope fill their eyes. Bram brings you a drink and you are relieved to have made it back as you unsling your packs and fall into your seats. You see your own relief magnified on the faces of those around you as they watch. That relief comes with great expectations as you can feel the weight of the city's hopes being placed squarely on your shoulders.

Men and women in polished chainmail and iron helms stand in squads, spears to their side. A few trembling hands tell you they would benefit from a boost in morale. Up ahead, a small stage has been erected where you can see the King standing, two Watchers flanking him. He tells the soldiers about the journey they will have to take and introduces you as their commanders. As you walk up to the dais, all eyes are on you. Alighting the wooden stairs, a sea of faces awaits your words.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_44__a">You start your speech and opt to tell the army the truth. That this road is fraught with danger and that the presence of so many will elicit a strong response from the Deepwood. You try to encourage them to stay sharp, and stay in formation at all times, but your words have little effect. Stepping down from the dais, and looking out at the sea of faces, you realize they are all too aware of the dangers that awaits them. Too late, you understand they have no problem believing in the danger, what they really needed was help believing in the mission.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_45__a">The soldiers start to sing, and you can hear their voices echo through the dark forest. For a short while, you feel their spirits being lifted. This place has not heard such sounds for a very long time.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_45__c">As you had expected the sounds have another effect, and the song is replied to by screeching in the underbrush as packs of multi-limbed Scrabblers charge the line.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_46__a">"You cut the song off with a word and march on, the only sounds ringing through the Deepwood are the clinks of metal armor and muffled conversation. You cannot risk making more noise than necessary as you know the Deepwood will react stronger and stronger to your presence. 

Inevitably, the silence is broken by the Deepwood as a screeching emits from the underbrush and packs of multi-limbed Scrabblers charge the line."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_47__a">Compared to the smaller skirmishes the army had before, this was already a larger attack, more concentrated, almost orchestrated. The creatures are fended off, but not without losses.</string>

Being strung up along the Wire Road left you not much choice in terms of army formation, but off it now, you need to decide how spread out your line should be as you proceed. 

A long, narrow line will mean that you make less noise, hopefully attracting fewer creatures. But on the other hand, if you concentrate your troops, you will have more strength for when the inevitable attack comes.

    <string name="chp18_1_4__a">"Easing into your drinks, you study Greycane. He had been Oathsworn himself once. The last survivor of his Free Company, he had earned a second chance and he had taken it. You have learned, few things can faze the fableman, yet the askance look he is giving you tells you he is uncomfortable. After a moment, he masters himself and heads over to your table. \"I… wanted you to hear this from me, before you hear it from anyone else… the King is dead. The boy was found with his throat slit but a few days back. Reports say a female assassin was involved. I looked into it myself. I can't tell for sure, but I think it was Elanna.\" You only half listen as Greycane presents the rest of his evidence, in your heart you know he is right. The murder could not have come at a worse time, it is as though all these events have been layered one atop the other to bring Verum to its knees.

The boy had the makings of a good King. Verum's chances are that much slimmer now he is gone. Such is the way of the Deepwood though, good things die to be replaced by something much worse. An unusual sensation creeps over you. Guilt. You deal with death daily as Oathsworn and your choices have led to many ends, both good and bad. You cannot afford to second guess yourself and stay sane as a member of a Free Company, yet your inability to stop Elanna in that alley plays over and over in your mind."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_50__a">"Easing into your drinks you study Greycane across the tent. He had been Oathsworn himself once. The last survivor of his Free Company, he had earned a second chance at a normal life and he had taken it. The grin on his face says he made the right choice. You begin to wonder what life would be like with a second chance, but cast off the notion. Such a thing would only come with the deaths of all those that sit around you and the plague makes your own death a near certainty. Knowing Greycane had lost his Free Company, as well as the horrors he must have endured, makes his grin all the more valuable. To smile in the face of all that suffering is worthy of respect.

Raising a mug to the man, he nods back, lifts his lute to his lap and plucks out an encouraging tune. The old instrument has lost a string since you last saw it, but like its owner, it is still capable of lifting the mood. Setting your heads together, you begin to mentally prepare yourself for what is to come. The muster is tomorrow and you know the time is here. The crusade into the Deepwood, your path to the Heart of Darkness and The Keening. 

With a hot meal inside you, and with Bram drying your travel gear by an amber fire, you retire for the night."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_51__a">Making eye contact with your allies, you know no words need to be exchanged. They need no encouragement. You offered to release them the night before, but every one of them refused. They are with you to the end.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_52__a">You tell your captains to convey your orders. It takes some time to organize the troops, but ultimately you think it is the right choice.</string>

    <string name="chp18_1_54__a">While the army was forming up, you sent out scouts to survey your surroundings, and they have come back with reports of two paths being open to you. Pulling out your compass you check your heading. You know the Salt Tower lies some way to the South but it appears only an East or West path is immediately open to you. The one to the West is denser and may take more time. To the east, one soldier from the scouting party was attacked by something, and many more strange plants were seen by the soldiers.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_6__a">Midge has grown these last months. He kept his nerve in Bastone and in the Deepwood after, and much like Greycane, he managed to keep a smile about him. You find you cannot deny the young man in this. You tell Midge that you will welcome him into the Company, but that he is going to need to stay close to you. You do not want him serving with the rest of the soldiers somewhere you cannot keep an eye on him.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_7__a">"Midge is brave, but still young. You look at him and shake your head, 'no'. His shoulders slump, even before you start to explain why he needs to remain behind. You tell him his best chance for survival lies with Greycane and Bram. You leave out the part where he may be more of a hindrance than a help beyond the wall. 

The disappointment lasts a moment, but then Midge squares his shoulders and smirks once again, his spirit refusing to be defeated. He mumbles an excuse about having some things he needs to take care of and hurries out of the tent. You regret not getting a proper goodbye, but admit that perhaps it is easier this way."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_8__a">"As the boy leaves, you make your way to the bar to where Greycane and Bram conspiratorially await. As you approach, they reveal steaming plates of sausages, eggs, yams, and soft bread alongside an assortment of side dishes from beneath the bartop. Hearty breakfast smells fill your nostrils and your stomachs rumble. 

\"A going away present,\" Bram says, \"The best Verum has to offer, for the best Verum has to offer,\" he says, extending a hand toward the food and then toward you. 

Greycane offers, \"If you don't ask what's in the sausages, you'll have a lovely meal.\" But his jest is half-hearted. You all know the truth of the situation. This meal is their way of saying goodbye, and this time is not like any of the others. This goodbye is a true farewell. Even if you succeed, you have no idea what will happen, nor whether you will make it back."</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_8__c">After the best breakfast you have had in as long as you can remember, you survey those gathered inside the tent. Many are your allies, sitting at their tables, still finishing their own plates. While you wait, you look to the tent flap. The muster waits just beyond, as does your responsibility.</string>
    <string name="chp18_1_9__a">"With the King dead, you know that morale will be low. No one is there to spur the troops on. The king was young, but charismatic. You know that he would now stand up there, on the dais before the palace, and deliver a speech to raise up their spirits and to prepare the soldiers for the march ahead. 

With the king gone, you have a choice. You could step in and make that speech. As the commanders of the army, it would be expected. On the other hand, you could have one last drink with your allies to reinforce the bonds of fellowship with those closest to you. After all, these are the folks you have trusted with your life, and they have done the same with you. This might be your last opportunity to enjoy a bit of shelter in peace.

The oxen pulling the carts are skittish and the men are not much more composed. A shout from the very back of the army has you running back down the line. 

As you approach, you hear the ring of steel against hard surfaces, a telltale sign of combat. By the time you reach the area, you see a few injured soldiers around the last supply wagon. You get them to explain what they saw, but they are having a hard time describing what happened. A pack of horned creatures, half-man and half-beast carrying twisted iron weapons had ambushed the column. Your mind immediately goes to the Scar Tribes you have fought, but the soldiers insist what hit them were no men, something else then. There was cunning in their attack, they had targeted the last wagon, killing a few soldiers and stealing some supplies before disappearing back into the shadows."</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_1__c">"Looking at the scene, you discover hoof prints and other strange markings. For all their speed, whatever these things are, they are not subtle.

    <string name="chp18_24_3__a">You spend the next few hours looking over your supplies and making sure to reorganize them as best as you can for travel. By the time you finish, there has been no sign of the soldiers sent to recover your supplies. You hear the rumors among the soldiers, wondering if you sent them to their deaths. Eventually, you know it must be time to move on.</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_4__a">The soldiers grumble, but they fall in line at your order. While some bemoan the loss of food, they begrudgingly admit that you are the experts of the Deepwood. You have proven your worth more than enough times to have them trust you when you tell them only death awaits them out there.</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_5__a">Keeping this steady pace lets you avoid the hazards of the Deepwood, but erring on the side of caution costs you the hunt. A few hundred yards into the woods the trail goes cold and without anything else to orient you, you know you will not be able to catch up to the creatures that stole your supplies. You return to the caravan empty-handed, a failure the soldiers note.</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_6__a">Increasing your pace, you feel you must be gaining on the creatures. Then the trail goes cold. Sliding to a halt, you strain your ears to ear.</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_7__a">"You hear them, a faint sound not far off. Passing a few more trees, you pick up the trail once more and sprint through the forest.

The Deepwood gets darker still but it is not long before you catch up to the pack. Just as the soldiers had said, these things stand like a man but are heavier and coated in bristly fur and horns, their hot breath emanating from goatlike muzzles. Unlike anything you have ever seen before these mockeries of men wear scraps of armor and carry cruel looking weapons. The Libre Monstrum has nothing like this within its pages, yet you suppose anything could live this far into the Deepwood and have gone unrecorded in the annals. 

Not wanting to lose the element of surprise, you hurl a dagger at the neck of the closest one and dive among them. A guttural braying rises in reply, and iron, muscle, fur and horns meet in combat."</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_7__c">"Whatever the creatures are, they bleed like everything else and also feel fear. As you cleave through the first handful, the rest scatter, abandoning their stolen goods where they fell.

Your task accomplished, you leave the dead and follow the trail back to your waiting army. They are delighted to find you safe, and more so, at your success. Word quickly spreads of your heroism."</string>
    <string name="chp18_24_8__a">You hear nothing. With the trail gone and without anything else to orient you, you know you will not be able to catch up to the creatures that stole your supplies. You return to the caravan empty-handed, a failure the soldiers note.</string>
    <string name="chp18_26_10__a">When the deed is done, you address those gathered around you. You explain the act was necessary and an act of mercy but the soldiers do not see it that way. The thought that they have to fear their commanders as well as the Deepwood remains with the army.</string>

It feels almost inviting, something which causes you to be on alert. Sure enough, shouting breaks the peace. A fight breaks out near one of the wagons. You stride back down the line to find a knot of soldiers shouting at one another. 

You slam your weapon into a nearby wagon to cut off their argument. One of the soldiers steps forward and points a finger angrily at the others.

\"I saw them go off the path! They got near the cysts! They're infected!\"

\"Liar, you got your thinking all backwards. We've been here the whole time,\" one of the others shouts back in reply.

There is no way to know for sure if they are in fact infected. And they would not admit to it if they were. If they are, it could be dangerous to the entire army. They show no signs of the spores now, but you know the black cloud disgorged by the cysts can take its time killing someone. They may even infect others without showing any symptoms. If they are infected they are already dead. If they are not, your decision may have the same effect. Looking at the other soldiers, you know what they think of the idea of having 'infected' in their midst. Soldiers are a superstitious lot.

They object, wanting to come with you and to continue to fight. When the tactic does not work, they turn to pleading. As the other squads around draw weapons to usher the condemned to the edge of the line, you speak up so all can hear.</string>
    <string name="chp18_26_3__a">"You choose to keep the potentially infected with the army. However, you keep a close eye on them and keep them separate from the others. Still, it is not enough to stop the whispers among the soldiers, the presence of the 'infected' adding to the paranoia of the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp18_26_4__a">Sending the troops back would be the same as killing them, whether or not they are infected, and you cannot spare the supplies. It would be a waste. Rather than give the order, you take care of the gruesome act yourself.</string>

Just as you are about to order the soldiers to fill up their tankards though, you spot a shadow near the water's edge. Something waits to ambush you. If you hope to gain the water, you will need to fight it. If you do not want to get near, an amber bomb should do the trick as well.

The noises of the Deepwood are a constant reminder of the ever-present danger, yet somehow this silence is more unnerving. Pressing on, you start to realize why it is so quiet. There are bones on the path ahead, and off to the sides, you can see more bones among the trees. The skeletons of great carnivores along with those of smaller animals litter the area.

With a gesture you set the column on high alert and draw your own weapons. You want to be ready for anything. To their credit, they form up quickly, but any hopes of readiness fade away as you hear the sound of buzzing coming from the trees. 

You know the sound all too well. A Burrower swarm. There must be a nest nearby. The flesh boring bugs nearly killed you on the Wire Road to Thrace, you had only survived that encounter by dumping your rations. There is no time to empty your wagons now, only leaving you with a few bad options. 

A dark thought rises in your mind that says you could lure the swarm away by sending a squad into the swarm's path to buy the rest time to escape. The alternative would be a fight on the line. Swords and spears will do little to deter the thousands of tiny creatures, but amber fire and the witches might be able to fend them off.

Knowing an airburst will be most effective, as the device flies through the air, you take aim with an arrow and loose it."</string>
    <string name="chp18_43_4__a">"You shout at the soldiers to spark amber torches while you stride to where the witches are. The Thracian witch, Aurelia, is still under the effects of the aether and will be of no use to you here, but the other two could be. You know they would never do so willingly under normal circumstances, but their lives are as much on the line here as everyone else's. Death by burrowers is a bad way to go. Taking them by the collars, you explain as much."</string>
    <string name="chp18_43_5__a">The arrow flies true and hits the bomb dead center. Before you can even smile, the explosion blinds you, its concussive force knocking you off your feet. The burrowers fall from the sky like black rain, the swarm is decimated. A cheer goes up from the line and one of the captains, Myler, reaches down to offer you a hand up. \"Reckless but impressive,\" she says, as you find your feet. The statement is true enough, it had been reckless and you wonder when such risks became normal for you. You surmise it goes back a long way. Taking the Oath is to take your life into your hands. At least this time it paid off. Setting the army back in its formation, you move out.</string>
    <string name="chp18_43_6__a">The arrow flies true, but the swarm is thick. Impacting one beetle after another the arrow slows in its flight and never reaches its target. As the burrowers swarm, the bomb hits the floor and explodes, blinding you. The concussive force blasts the swarm, and hundreds fall like black rain. It has not stopped them all though. Men scream as the remnants of the swarm reach the line. Biting and boring, the burrowers search for eyes, ears and mouths.

You do not recall seeing it on any map. With the brush incredibly thick to either side, it looks like the only path is through. Cautiously, you step into the shadow of the village, leading the army behind you. 

As the column reaches the village center, you spot movement off to your left, and then again to your right. Shadows coalesce into dozens of Mandragors, heads low and stalking. Reptilian eyes fix on you and hungering tongues flit out to taste the air. The village has become a nest. As if by some signal, the creatures screech and, as one, charge the line. The terrain is not favorable for bringing your army to bear on these creatures, but knowing you must protect the wagons and the witches, you shout your own order to repel the assault."</string>
    <string name="chp18_47_2__a">"Great gouts of acidic bile disgorge from the mouths of the Mandragors, melting armor and flesh, the tight conditions working to their advantage.

You are food to the Mandragors, and among the close fighting, some manage to drag away both men and supplies.

Rain runs off waxed cloaks and wagon canvas in rivulets, and the ground is churned to mud beneath your boots. Keeping watch under such conditions is difficult, but you need little visibility to sense the next horror you must face. As you trudge through the rain the ground begins to quake. 

One of the soldiers behind you shouts and points at what looks like a river of mud heading in your direction. Another Wyrm, this time bigger… much bigger."</string>

Some dozen paces from the line, a great explosion of earth reveals an enormous eyeless fiend. You have faced Wyrms before, but nothing like this. This thing is ancient, the usually pink skin replaced by thick black hide covered in moss, and great gnarled tusks extend from its gaping maw. Whether it was the rain or the noise of your army that drew this thing from the deep you do not know. All you do know is, this fight will be different.

You order the bowmen to loose, and arrows ping off the leathery underbelly of the ancient Wyrm. Shouting for spearmen to form ranks, you hope the topside of the thing is less well armored. Undeterred by your bowmen, it crashes down among you and the battle begins."</string>

There is no way down from here, but at least you have seen your destination. The mere sight of it ripples through the soldiers, energizing their spirits.

    <string name="chp18_85_1__c">"Standing high above the trees, it is a sight to behold. A shard of civilization, jutting up from amid the chaotic sea of trees. Within a dozen paces of the Salt Tower's walls, nothing grows, the salt infused into the stone and the earth there holding it at bay. Even the monsters have given it a wide berth and no sign of tooth or claw mars the structure's defenses. Although it has stood for centuries, it still looks strong and sturdy, and you will be grateful to be inside the walls. At last, you have reached some measure of safety, and the midpoint on your journey to the Heart of Darkness.

As if mocking your thought of safety, the ground around you begins to rumble. You do not know whether it is coincidence or somehow the mindless Wyrm sensing your escape. Whatever the case, it is coming for you, and coming fast. 

You bellow for your soldiers to run to the sanctuary of the tower. If you can only reach it…

It is not long before this feeble hope is crushed and tossed aside. The ancient Wyrm erupts out of the ground at the front of your line, sending you hurtling through the air and landing on your back. The force of the impact drives the wind from your body, and you wince as you force yourself to your feet, struggling to breathe. But there is no time to recover.

Most of the line is behind you, but the vanguard of your army is in the thick of it. Among the dozen there, you see one soldier standing bravely against the Wyrm, his sword slashing back and forth across the creature's flank. Looking into the faceplate of the soldier's helm, you are struck by a sudden realization. You recognize those eyes. It's Midge!

The boy had ignored your orders to stay behind, and somehow embedded himself in the army without your knowledge. Now Midge is here, right in the midst of the Wyrm's attack. Frustration and fear for the boy rise up in equal measure. You must save him."</string>
    <string name="chp18_85_5__a">"With a battle cry, you charge the beast, hoping to get its attention. If you can keep it away from the vanguard, they might be able to reach the walls while you face off against the massive beast. From there, they can lay down fire on the Wyrm's exposed topside and add to the damage you will inflict. Also the more you save, the higher the chances of saving Midge."</string>
    <string name="chp18_85_6__a">Looking over your shoulder, you see the army is terrified. This beast has hounded them for days, and it follows many into their nightmares. They stand their ground, yet it is beyond them to charge with you. Without them, the fight will be more difficult.</string>

Before you can close your eyes, a shout echoes through the night. \"Wyrm!\" 

Scrabbling to your feet, you retrieve your weapons. Strangely, you feel no vibrations. Heading in the direction of the voice, you find the soldier responsible and demand an explanation. \"It was there, I saw the soil rise, and then it was gone.\" Looking out into the darkness, you do not see anything. You begin to ask if the soldier could have been mistaken, but then you feel it, the vibrations are back and intensifying quickly. You shout for the soldiers to wake, and most are on their feet, when a great mouth erupts from beneath one of the wagons. The warning of the soldier had been the only thing that had saved the squad sleeping against the wagon. As they dive out the way, the wagon lifts into the air in an explosion of earth and tusks. Clamping down on the frame, the Wyrm clenches its jaws, and the wagon bursts in a splinter of wood and canvas."</string>
    <string name="chp18_86_2__c">"As the head of the Wyrm extends from the earth, you note the wounds on its black hide, somehow already scarred over. This ancient Wyrm is the same one you drove off before, and what you feared has come to pass. The Wyrm's attacks had not been random, or bound to some territory of the Deepwood.

Clamping down on the frame, the Wyrm clenches its jaw, and the wagon bursts in a splinter of wood and canvas."</string>

Moving to the bodies, you force yourself to go over to the collection of the dead. Turning over one crushed corpse after another you start to gain hope he is not here either, but then you find him. 

Laying against the base of a tree, he looks almost like he is sleeping. The cold pallor of his skin tells you otherwise. His usually smiling face is now still and peaceful. Thankfully it had been quick. 

While the rest of the bodies are little more than a calculated loss - casualties of war - Midge's strikes a painful chord that makes your breath catch. He had been with you since Bastone, survived ordeals with the plagues and in the Deepwood only to fall here. He deserved better. 

Your hand tightens into a fist, hard enough to make your arm begin to tremble. You have no idea how long you stood there, but eventually a soldier comes over and places an arm on your shoulder to stir you back to the present.

As your first day off the Wire ends, night breaks and you need to decide how to handle the night watches. Since Verum you have had a more forgiving approach, allowing the soldiers to sleep more as they become accustomed to the march and the terrors of the Deepwood. Now as you are further in, and the Deepwood becomes increasingly aware of your presence, you face the question of whether to increase the guard.

You may have a strong watch, where half the soldiers are awake while the other half sleep. They will not like it, but it will keep them alive. Or you institute a rotation of three shifts, giving each soldier more sleep, but also offering less fighting power should you come under attack.

You listen to their stories and collect their names, committing as many as you can to memory. There is even occasional laughter as soldiers tell stories. Perhaps the camaraderie keeps the shadows at bay. 

Heading back to your bedroll, you recite the names of those you met tonight, knowing the next time you call on them may be when you tally the butcher's bill. 

When you wake in the morning, the Quartermaster requests your attention and instruction for handing out supplies over the next several days.

Just that simple act alone eases the tension from their shoulders, makes them work a little harder, or even brings a smile to their lips. It is not much, but it makes a difference, and any weapon to stave off nightmares is important.

About halfway through the line, you hear several cracks off to the side. You turn in time to see trees topple over like blades of grass underneath an armored boot as something you had hoped never to see again bursts into view.

The package tumbles through the air and explodes against the side of what passes for its face. With the sound of crystal rain, it erupts in a burst of light, shredding the unearthed segment.

Then you find them, the wardens have been crushed and the witches thrown clear by the death throes of the Wyrm. Looking at the witches, you see the two females are unconscious but the third, the male witch from Cisterica, is on his feet.

Free of his dark iron restraints, lightning cracks from his fingertips and he releases a charged streak of lightning that strikes the soldiers closest to him. Two fall immediately, burning in their armor, but a third raises her weapon. She is within striking distance and ready to deal a lethal blow.

Shock covers the woman's face as the witch smiles, ready to raise his other hand toward her, lightning crackling once more.

\"My lords, it's the young witch, she's waking up!\" You hurry over and see the witch from Thrace is shaking, her eyes moving behind her lids. She is not fully awake yet, and before she can become so, you reach for the aether in your satchel and administer another dose of the powerful sedative. She should not have needed it for some time.

The last few evenings have been the hardest yet. The weather itself seems to have turned against you, alternating between blistering mugginess and a gnawing chill where your breath fogs and you have to keep moving to prevent the chill from seeping into your bones. During the night, the trees creak and crack even when there is no wind, setting everyone on edge.

To make matters worse, supplies are running low enough that fires are a luxury. In the entire army, only three fires are allowed, and those are kept low. The other camps have torches to keep the darkness at bay, but that is all. 

As you make your rounds, the ground starts to shake and rumble. Several people stumble to a knee and have to put a hand against the ground for balance. Most of the soldiers scramble for weapons and you find yourself gripping yours before you are even aware of reaching for them. Trees just to the side of your encampment crack and crash to the ground, but only shadows can be seen. Something large is moving out there, just beyond the circle of light. One soldier hurls a torch into the darkness, but it hits the ground and sputters, going out without revealing anything.

The entire area appears to have been the site of a fierce battle. Everywhere you look, there are hundreds of charred bodies, melted iron and wood rendered to ash. Beyond the crumbled remains of the wall, you can see the Spire reaching into the clouds. 

Climbing over the rubble pile here at the gate, you should be able to reach the Spire. Your only other option would be to continue up the street, toward your left, and head for the massive tree.

    <string name="chp19_13_2__c">Pushing up the avenue toward the giant tree, all of the buildings begin to look the same and before you realize what is happening, a thick, darkening fog swallows you up. Ambient light quickly begins to fade as the shadows press in around you.</string>
    <string name="chp19_13_3__a">Barely able to see your hand in front of your face, it becomes clear you will not be able to continue this way and order the troops back up the street in the opposite direction. Your only choice now is to pass through the charred remains of the iron gate and head for the Spire.</string>
    <string name="chp19_13_4__a">As your world is robbed of light, you feel a malevolence prickling your skin. Without hesitating, you give the order to retreat as curling tendrils of fog reach for your troops. You hear voices cry for help before fading away. The roar of clanking metal and boots trampling on stone fills the air as the caravan sprints up the street, back in the opposite direction. When you finally burst from the choking fog and gather the troops, you find an entire squad has gone missing.</string>
    <string name="chp19_13_4__c">Your only choice now is to head back through the charred remains of the iron gate and make your way to the Spire.</string>
    <string name="chp19_14_1__c">"The pair of Square Towers rise to either side of a huge, ornate building adorned with stained glass windows, which remarkably are still intact. Colorful mosaics decorate the beautiful panes of glass, each depicting one of three distinct figures who appear to be human. One wields a hammer, another holds a brush, and the third is a robed individual with a cowl pulled down low, hiding their face. The only other place you have seen buildings such as this are the cathedrals of Cistercia, but there are no signs of The One here. Besides, it seems these people may have worshiped the three figures depicted in the stained glass windows. Perhaps these were their gods? 

You notice the great doors on the front of the building are slightly ajar. It will be dark soon, however, you may be able to find more information if you choose to search inside.

Inside, you see numerous corpses all huddled around a series of statues. Suddenly a frigid breeze from inside the building rushes past you. Quickly closing the massive door, you think it best to move on before whatever caused the strange gust decides to show itself.</string>
    <string name="chp19_14_3__c">You decide it is worth the risk to spend some of your precious light sources to investigate the great building. Illuminating your way through the massive hall, you find a large number of well-preserved corpses huddled around statues of the three figures from the stained glass windows. It seems many of the cityfolk had flocked here when the terrible fate that befell this city struck. As your search progresses, you learn that these three figures were not revered as gods per se, but more like symbols of virtue. A Triumvirate, which consisted of The Artist, The Alchemist and The Worker. A society without a god is a new concept to you. The implications are vast and daunting but you have no time to consider them.</string>
    <string name="chp19_14_3__e">There are obviously no items of use here, so you order the search party back outside.</string>
    <string name="chp19_14_4__a">"Because this place was built on a hill, you are still able to spot a few of the city's landmarks. The large Spire is easiest to find, rising from what you believe is the center of the city. To the left of the Spire, far off in the distance, you also see a great tree rising up through the fog.

While it is a relief to see Quintus' renewed faith, a part of you wonders what Verum's current affliction means. People certainly call to the one within its walls, yet plague still ravages the capital. Is judgement coming once again? Is the One indifferent? Or, is there a higher purpose at work here?"</string>

    <string name="chp19_15_16__a">"Stepping into the Spire is like entering a different world. Smooth white walls reflect the light of a gigantic central pillar of glass filled with luminous energy as it stretches high into the Spire's apex. Arcs of lightning dance up and down the height of the tower in an electric blue storm. Stairs wind around the outer wall of the central core and break off at various points into walkways that lead to rooms in the shell of the Spire. Drooping from the central column, you also see hundreds of thick iron cables, much like the kind used to construct the Wire Road. These cables run into the walls outside each of the rooms above. You have never seen a structure like this before, and cannot imagine how this energy is contained, let alone harnessed for some intended purpose. At least there is no chance for any Shadow to exist here; the light is everywhere.

Your party cautiously ascends the staircase, peeking inside the peripheral rooms as you climb toward the apex. Inside the rooms, you find heavily decayed human remains, the bones of which turn to powder when you disturb them. Strangely, these corpses were not preserved like the ones found elsewhere in the city, some seem to sit in silent repose as though they died in their seats. Many simply fell where they stood and none show the damage indicative of combat that covers those outside. The mystery deepens as you reach the summit. 

At the top of the central staircase, you come to a large ornate door which opens to a grand rotunda. This circular room is the very peak of the tower. The countless shelves of books and scrolls stored here lead you at first to believe it is some kind of archive, but you quickly learn it is much more than that. Devices and mechanisms of manifold form sit atop richly carved tables and other strange machines hang motionlessly from metal armatures attached to heavy bases.

One could spend years in this room, delving through its secrets. The knowledge hidden here could be useful to a Free Company. Unfortunately, you do not even have a day to spare with time being your most precious commodity in this forsaken city.

    <string name="chp19_15_17__a">"Heading deeper in you find a raised dais and large desk upon it. You had found no other occupants in this room but here you see a solitary figure cloaked and cowled. The unmistakable form of a Watcher. 

The Watcher does not move as you step up onto the dais and as you approach the desk you see why. The Watcher is dead too, one skeletal hand resting eternally on a book in front of it.

Trying not to disturb the dead you carefully pry the book from under the Watcher's hand. - it seems to be a journal, used to record the events that transpired here. Some of the pages are illegible, but you can still make out a few of the entries. 

'…The opportunity was too great to ignore. With endless life, we could have united humanity, bringing reason and the Triumvirate to all. Then we would have been ready when 'it' came. Such hubris, such folly…' 

The entry breaks off and picks up a few pages later.

'…Liak was chosen. He was sent to Soonari and Kharnus, proffering an outstretched hand to them while he concealed the other. The A'Dendri never suspected his true mission, and he was able to retrieve the Life Giver. Of course they discovered the truth eventually, but it no longer mattered. All that we were concerned with was the promise it held…'

There are several more indiscernible pages before the entry resumes.

'…The war was predicted and accounted for. Their forces outnumbered, their strategy out maneuvered. They could not stand against the Luminarchs or the Golems. Casualties were within parameters and far heavier losses were incurred on the A'Dendri. The ends justified the…'

There is another break in the text.

'…Victory was nearly within our grasp when the madness befell us. It was something in the air. In a single day, the entire city was lost. We do not know where it came from, but its effects were immediate and lethal. The people began tearing at each other, striking down their own kin as if they were sworn enemies. They butchered each other in the streets and in their own houses. The Golems held the gates to the Spire, and killed hundreds in doing so. The bodies piled high, though we were safe here. The Life Giver protected us, but we were walled in our own tower. Then the woods came.'

From the Spire we could see it, a black growth grinding up the land. Villages, fields, roads and rivers, all consumed. The kingdom collapsed and the city fell with it. Any that left the Spire's safety fell to madness. We had one means of survival.'

After two more pages, the text continues.

'…blood tie was weak with the first three subjects but the fourth opened a portal large enough for passage. While the other went through to Verum I maintained the link. The knowledge must survive even though I die…' 

Another break.

'…Shadows have risen in the city and the dead do not rot, there is some connection there. Experiments conducted beyond the Spire have led to negative results. Remaining servants show signs of trauma…'

More illegible text.

'… had to kill the servants. Starvation has gnawed at their minds and they could not be allowed to destroy the knowledge kept here. If you are reading this, perhaps the great task is finally complete…'

Another break leads to the final entry. 

'… have been here alone for many years now. The gift of the Life Giver now my curse. I will take my life soon, but I fear what awaits me beyond. Would that the teaching of the Triumvirate were true. Would that we return to the dust and nothingness. How wrong we were…'

Slowly closing the journal, you try to make sense of what you have read. What had the Watchers done?

As you approach, the sight of a hulking object stomping through the surrounding square sends you diving for cover. The shape moves with a familiar swaying gait as it stalks the base of the Spire. Though its design is more crude, the number of mutilated corpses discarded near the tower's entrance proves it is no less lethal than its more familiar cousin. A Golem, like the one given to you by the Watchers, guards this Spire and you will need a plan if you hope to get past it alive.

The notes explain how mixing the various vials together can create either an analgesic effect or a paracea in the resulting tincture. You are sure you have heard the word paracea before somewhere. Judging from the amount of liquid in the vials, there is only enough for one attempt.

    <string name="chp19_15_26__a">"Before leaving, you inspect the deceased Watcher more closely. Slowly pulling back the cowl, you find its skin rotted away. Apparently, whatever forces are responsible for preserving the corpses outside the Spire have no power here. The skull you see is vaguely human, but there is something else to it. It seems deformed and green marrow shows through the bone's structure. Whatever the Watchers are, they are not human anymore.

Leaving the Watcher's skeleton you step out onto a small balcony. This is the highest point in the city, giving you a good overview of the fog covered city beneath. 

Straight ahead, you see the Gatehouse you are trying to reach. In order to get there, you will need to pass very close to thick, dark fog. To the left of the gate, slightly closer, you see the great tree, which from your current vantage point, clearly has a series of platforms and small buildings built into it. 

As you are about to depart, you catch a glimpse of something moving outside the city walls. The Deepwood trees are shaking. Looking closer, you realize it is the horde of monsters that attacked when you arrived. They are moving around the city toward the gate you have been trying to reach, and they appear to be giving this forsaken city a wide berth as they do so. If they reach the other side of the city first, you will be cut off. You have to get to the gate soon. As fast as you can you mobilize and head back into the city.

The ancient construct stands no chance against the more heavily armored hulk of your Golem. With dark iron fists it rips off one of the defending golem's arms and, wrenching aside its breastplate, plunges a fist into its mechanical core. An explosion rocks the area, sending sparks and metal shards flying. When the smoke clears, only your Golem remains.

With dark iron fists your golem rips off one of the defender's arms, whilst the defender crushes one of your golem's legs. 

Pounding metal again and again your golem takes a blow to the mouthplate and a terrible noise emanates from the ruin of its face. In return your golem wrenches aside its enemy's breastplate, and plunges a fist into its mechanical core. An explosion rocks the area, sending sparks and metal shards in all directions. Once the smoke clears neither golem remains.

    <string name="chp19_15_4__c">"After observing the Golem for some time, you detect a potential weakness near the back of its neck where the metal plating has left some of its inner workings unprotected. With a well-placed thrust, you may be able to disable the giant.

Knowing this is a task best left to him, the Blade springs from cover and bolts for the Golem. Bounding from a fallen pillar, he soars through the air with his sword held tightly, ready to stab downward. At the last moment, the Golem senses the strike and blocks it with a thick iron fist. The Blade is already rolling away to his side as the return blow falls and the iron fist crushes only flagstone. Rising in a graceful arc, the Blade pivots and thrusts his weapon deep into the Golem's neck. With all his might he wrenches at the mounting plate and the head comes free. Immediately, a strange light begins to emanate and spark from the Golem. At a dead run the Blade slides behind cover moments before the metallic mass of the golem explodes.

When its back is turned, one of you rushes the construct and slams a blade into the back of its neck before it has a chance to defend itself. With the weapon stuck in the base of its head, the Golem flails uselessly about before crashing to the ground in a graceless tumble.

Having yet to find a Royal Palace and considering the centralized location and size of the Spire, you get the distinct impression that the Watchers had once held the seat of power in this city. This building may well have been the first Raven Spire. 

You need to get inside and investigate, but the door is sealed tight by some strange mechanism of cogs. Each of the cogs has eight teeth, and there are three openings around the perimeter which emit a faint glow. Another three openings, symmetrically spaced in relation to the glowing ones, are still dark."</string>

Closely studying the notes, you realize they are talking about the streams of colorful lights which appear in the sky with each new moon. You know them as the Witch Light, the phenomenon feared by all of humanity that is said to enhance the power of witches and cause foul things to awaken beneath the Deepwood trees. There are some who believe the tales are simply myths told to frighten children, but you know better. Free Companies can always expect more work when the Witch Light shines. Most people choose to stay indoors when the phenomenon occurs, yet it seems the people of this forsaken kingdom had been closely studying it.

Looking into the tired, frightened faces of your army, one is suspiciously missing - Samil's. You know what you saw, although it is hard to believe. Whatever the truth about Samil, you know you are alive because of him.

Returning your gaze to the city, you find a forgotten realm of derelict buildings, wreathed in a low-hanging fog. An eerie silence hangs over the jungle of stone and timber like a cowl, oppressive and thick. After ordering the troops to hold their position, you ascend the gatehouse tower to take in a wider view of the overall landscape.

From the elevated vantage point, you look out upon a sea of fog, broken only by the dark silhouettes of buildings, towers and decorative columns. Even through the obstructed view, you can tell the city is larger than Verum, and will take several days to cross. While discussing your options, a member of your group discovers an odd cylindrical object laying amongst a pile of rags. A piece of glass caps each end of the cylinder and as you lift the object to your eye, you see the world far off in the distance as though it were just before you. The device is truly unlike anything you've seen before, and with it you are able to gather how truly massive this dead city is. If you hope to make it to Raven's Reach, you will need to find a way through it.

Peering through the new device, you carefully survey the layout of the city below, noting major landmarks. The most obvious of which is a wide chasm marring a large portion of the city, its jagged edges stabbing down into an abyss. You also find pockets of Deepwood rising above the cloudbank where the foul trees must have gained purchase. Amongst the scattered remains of damaged buildings, the fog also appears more dense in some areas and writhes like a living thing that makes your hackles rise. Searching further afield you seek out any city gates that may provide a point of exit but you find only one. Far off on the other side of the city, you can barely make out the gatehouse that is now your destination."</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_13__c">"To aid with your navigating the city, you sketch a quick map as reference on a scrap of parchment. There are three traversable routes from your current location. One leads to the left, eventually taking you past a squat building accented by a pair of square-shaped towers. A second path cuts toward a towering spire in the central area of the city. And the last route leads you down to the right, where a large chimney rises from the rubble. Whichever path you take, you'll need to get moving soon to keep the soldiers under your command alert and focused on the mission.

Her pace is slower, but at least the compound has stolen her will to fight. The same cannot be said for the man who tugs at his lead like an ornery dog. You ignore his impotent rebellion for now knowing you would do the same in their place. However, the final piece of precious cargo is the most difficult to manage. You have told yourselves it is for the good of the kingdom, still you find it difficult to meet the gaze of your former companion. And though by this point she obliges your commands without struggle, the pain behind her eyes is hard to bear. The thought of The Keening rises up in you once more and you try to suppress the looming choice. You remind yourself you have orders to follow but the unease cares little for your rationalization. You turn away from the witches, leaving the choice unmade.</string>

    <string name="chp19_1_1__a">"You wake with a start, the metallic taste of blood and salt still in your mouth. Looking down the line of troops, their exhausted faces beg for reprieve, but a few blessed hours of sleep is all you can afford for now. You are only half way to Raven's Reach and there are still miles and miles of deadly, unrelenting Deepwood to traverse. Your presence here will only attract more beasts and nightmares to your caravan the longer you tarry. Another attack like the one suffered by the Wyrm could sap whatever courage and hope remains of the army. You need to get back on the march."</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_1__c">"Your numbers have dwindled since leaving Verum, the Deepwood claiming lives with every mile you cover in this hellish domain. You can only hope there will be enough of you left at the journey's end. As the soldiers gather to your muster call, they bring forward a stash of weapons and gear that had been found hidden in the rubble. Despite untold years of exposure to rain and rot, the equipment is in excellent condition. You could take the items for yourself, or distribute them among the army, no doubt increasing their morale.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_2__a">Though none would dare admit it, the truth is some lives are more valuable than others. The success of the mission depends on your staying alive, and this equipment will help ensure that. Thankfully the soldiers understand this as well.</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_3__a">Morale is a fickle creature, but few things stir the troops quite like shiny new gear. You decide to present the armor and weapons as gifts to the squad leaders, thanking each of them by name for their courage and leadership. The gesture has its desired effect as the soldiers break in their new equipment with smiles and light banter, a brief distraction from the dangers that lay ahead. The truth is, you will most likely be salvaging those weapons from their dead bodies before long.</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_4__a">"The rustle of weapons and thudding of boots into green muck herald the caravan's departure from the Salt Tower. Your most precious cargo will be under your charge for the remainder of this journey. Taking up the three dark iron chains, you haul the witches to their feet."</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_5__c">"The first leg of the journey seems quieter than the days previous, but as the sun reaches its zenith, the fetid woods become increasingly unsettled. Reports of small skirmishes break out as squads put down packs of creatures in increasing frequency and a change seems to be coming over the woods. You begin to notice it yourself. At first it was just the occasional skittering of smaller creatures through the underbrush, but that rustling has now grown into a distant symphony of growls and snapping tree limbs. You feel the anxiety rising in the troops, when suddenly the welcome sight of gray stone walls breaks through the gloom. A great gate rises above you and you realize you are looking upon a vast city. 

The soldiers are relieved at this sign of civilization but the warning of the Watcher ends any hopes of you experiencing the same. This must be the forbidden city. No safety would be found within and he had warned you to give the dead city a wide berth as none had ever entered and lived to tell about it. You could head North or South around the city, both are similar distances and with the Deepwood as it is, one may not present a safer journey than the other. You call the squad leaders together to deliberate the best course of action knowing your destination, Raven's Reach, lies just beyond. 

As though sensing your distraction, the Deepwood uses this moment to strike. A frenzied tide of fanged creatures and clawed nightmares burst from the treeline. Squad leaders immediately begin barking out commands as the soldiers' instincts quickly take over, forming a defensive line. Drawing your weapons, you join the battle where the fighting is fiercest."</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_5__e">Despite making short work of the first wave, more and more monsters continue to pour in. You have never seen the Deepwood throw its abominations in coordinated legions like this. They usually gnaw at each other, as much as intruders, yet this army of death appears united in a singular purpose - to kill you.</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_6__a">"You are forced to give ground under the press of beasts and rabid, snapping jaws. If you do not do something quickly, this will be your last stand. Stealing a glance over your shoulder, you eye the giant metal gate of the forsaken city. Perhaps you stand a better chance against whatever awaits you in there.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_7__a">You call out the order for a fighting retreat. The commands trickle down the defense line as soldiers begin moving further back in organized squads, forming a semicircle in front of the city gates. Freeing yourselves from combat, you search for a way to open the tall iron gates, but find none. No handle, no lever, no smaller door.</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_8__a">"Over the din of battle, you roar a battlecry, commanding your soldiers to hold their ground. True to your warrior code, you will make a stand here. There is no telling what horrors lurk on the other side of the city's iron gate. Far better to take your chances against an enemy you know well."</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_8__c">You had hoped to break the enemy by allowing them to smash against you like water on rock. This is no flash flood you are facing though. This is something you have never seen before. The fighting quickly intensifies as waves of beasts crash the defensive line in an unrelenting avalanche. Your men fight bravely, but it is not enough, and you soon realize the hopelessness of a standing fight against the endless horde. Lives may be lost inside the forsaken city, but to stay here is certain death. You have no choice but to find a way through the city gates.</string>
    <string name="chp19_1_9__a">"The screams of your dying men urge your frantic search. Fingers claw and pry at every crack and crevice in the door. You batter and smash your weapons against the gate in desperation, but the cold iron refuses to yield. More men fall under the deadly waves, and the beasts quickly fill the gaps left behind. With grim resolve, you return to the fight, smashing and slicing with fiery rage. If you are to die here, then so be it.

Suddenly the sounds of grinding metal and rusted hinges scrape behind you. Metal grates against stone as the towering dark gate begins to judder. Risking a look over your shoulder, you watch as the crack of light slicing between the doors widens ever so slightly - and then you see him. Pushing the massive iron gate open is Samil! He meets your shocked gaze with calm eyes as he waves you inside.

You stare ominously at the specter of your former companion, unsure of whether to trust him. The tide of nightmarish creatures is growing like a rolling thunder behind you. Soldiers are already breaking formation and bolting for the safety of the city. You realize it does not matter. There is no choice but to follow. 

Ushering men and women into the dead city, you see a few squads have the presence of mind to drag supplies and a few wagons in with them, but you see others preparing to break formation and leave other supplies behind. You know you need to give orders before this becomes a rout. You could risk more soldiers to secure the supplies or abandon most of the supplies to get most of your squads out safely."</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_1__c">"The Gatehouse looms just beyond a final row of homes. You have nearly made it out of this cursed city. Muffled sighs of relief rise from the troops when you feel a frigid breeze cut through the air. Turning to look behind, you see the great thick fog banks you have been trying to avoid moving, curling toward you. Whatever has itself wrapped around this city is waking up. Then, from the advancing fog comes the stuff of nightmares, an amalgam of shadows as large as the street. Rolling over itself to get to you, thousands of shadowy hands and faces extend out from its surface reaching out with an all consuming hunger. 

The ground rumbles and the walls of the buildings collapse beneath its malignant touch, spraying the street in debris."</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_1__e">"You desperately search for an alley to escape down, but the dense fog seems to come from everywhere. From the corner of your eye you spot more movement and wheel around only to see Samil, his wraith-like arm guiding you toward a path you had not seen. Having no other choice, you sprint for the open street. Running for your life, you come to an intersection and once again see Samil urging you down another avenue. You sense the dark mist gaining on you, but dare not look back as you follow your dead friend. 

Finally, you reach the end of the street and see the massive city gate before you, its doors barred by a thick iron beam. It will take an incredible amount of strength to remove the iron beam and open the gate, but it is not impossible. Your only other choice is to climb the steps of the Gatehouse and leap down into the Deepwood. Every second you delay brings you closer to death.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_2__a">You bound up the tower steps two at a time, peeking over your shoulder to see the roiling darkness fill the street behind you, rising like a serpent about to strike. At the top of the tower, the Deepwood opens out before you. Taking a breath, you jump.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_2__c">You crash through tainted tree limbs and sharp branches, landing hard on the Deepwood floor. Dragging yourself to your feet, you look around and find not everyone has survived the fall. Several of your men lie broken in the muck, never to rise again.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_3__a">You quickly order the squads to the gate and begin the countdown to lift the heavy beam as the darkness rushes toward you.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_4__a">You order your troops to shield their eyes, and smash a light orb onto the street. It explodes in brilliant white light, knocking the wave of pitch-black fog off course. It crashes into a nearby building with the force of a mountain, toppling several homes.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_4__c">The delay buys you enough time to begin lifting the heavy beam barring the gate.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_5__a">The Ursus at your side charges forward, powerful legs propelling it to the gate. Squads are already trying to lift the giant cross beam that bars the gate but to no avail. Then the Ursus hits the gate, claws gripping the ancient trunk of wood.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_6__a">With one final heave, the giant beam is freed. The huge gate swings open on creaking hinges as your Company pushes over the threshold of the cursed city.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_7__a">The blackness crashes against one of your squads and they disappear, their screams muted as they are consumed.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_7__c">Their death buys you the precious time needed to heave the beam free. The huge gate swings open on creaking hinges as your Company pushes over the threshold of the cursed city.</string>
    <string name="chp19_20_9__a">Your Golem grips the gate in iron fists as you hold out the control rod. With a grinding of metal it pushes against the giant beam holding the gate shut. It budges an inch then lifts clear of its housing and falls to the ground. The gate is pushed open and your company rushes over the threshold of the cursed city.</string>
    <string name="chp19_21_1__c">"Your path brings you to a neighborhood that looks much different than the other ornately designed areas you have walked through up until now. Between the rows of buildings are the charred remnants of Wychwood trees and A'Dendri dwellings. The humans and A'Dendri must have lived side by side in this neighborhood."</string>
    <string name="chp19_21_2__a">"The sight of destroyed homes, both human and A'Dendri, reminds you of what befell the Green Streets of Verum. You witnessed the same fate suffered by this charred neighborhood in your own city. It seems it is true what they say about history repeating itself."</string>
    <string name="chp19_21_3__a">"Walking through the charred dwellings, you cannot help but think of the Green Streets of Verum, a neighborhood you were narrowly able to save. Perhaps the Green Streets will one day be like this neighborhood was, humans and A'Dendri living together in peace. Perhaps that will be part of the legacy you leave behind."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_10__a">Sedric begins to pounce but you catch him. He starts to protest but you silence him with a look. Behind you, the sound of skittering feet and snapping limbs grows closer as the horde rushes through the Deepwood. You have no choice but to stand and fight. Ordering the troops to hold the rear against the smaller creatures, you draw your weapons and nod to Sedric. You will take her down together.</string>

Ordering the troops to hold the rear against the smaller creatures, you draw your weapons and prepare to face the Broodmother matriarch.</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_1__a">Free at last, you look back toward the city and see the massive dark mist writhing furiously as thick tendrils the size of towers crawl up the city walls, desperate to escape their prison. Thousands of horrified, tortured faces scream silently within the roiling black cloud as it reaches for you. It does not cross the threshold though. Thankfully, whatever horror abides in the city seems to be bound to it, forever confining its malevolence within the walls.</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_1__c">"The flight through the city and the constant battle against fear have drained your reserves yet you know you cannot rest yet. The swarm of beasts that attacked you upon arrival is heading this way and will cut you off before long. You must get to Raven's Reach by nightfall, if you hope to survive. Checking your equipment and quickly tallying your troops, you prepare to head out."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_2__a">Your final count tallies just thirty five soldiers, only a fraction of what you left Verum with. They will have to be enough. Your only consolation is that these brave men and women are the toughest, most loyal of the bunch. Knowing what lies ahead, there is still much more you will need to ask of them.</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_3__a">"Your final count tallies just thirty soldiers, only one tenth of the force you left Verum with. These walking wounded will be your brothers and sisters for the battle ahead. Verum's best and last chance for survival. They will have to be enough."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_4__a">"Your final count tallies just twenty five soldiers, only a fraction of what you left Verum with. The number of survivors is low, but at least the entire army was not lost. These men and women will have to be enough for the fight ahead. Verum's best and last chance for survival."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_5__a">"The soldiers are weary but Raven's Reach is less than a dozen furlongs from the city gate. Checking your compass, you order the remains of your army to move at double pace. As you plunge back into the wall of trees, you hope your orientation is correct. Whether it is or not you have no choice but to keep going forward.

Pushing past branches and wet vines you carve through the Deepwood toward the fortress. The air is thick and filled with a pregnant silence. Then a screech pierces the gloom off to the North. The horde has caught up to you and is trying to cut you off. You spur on your squads to move even faster."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_6__a">"You sprint through the trees, all sense of subtlety lost as you know they are coming for you. Bursting over a hill you finally see the high stone walls of Raven's Reach rise up before you. You almost make it to the gate, when the Broodmother barrels through a tree in front of you snapping it in half. The thing is enormous, a matriarch of her race much larger than the ones you have fought before. Dozens of hungry eyes writhe on its back and sickness washes over you as the putrid stench of the thing hits you. The gate is right before you, yet the great form of the Broodmother is between you and the safety of the fortress."</string>

Sedric sprints then leaps like a cat. Burying his blades into the Broodmother's flanks. Giant rats snap and claw at his face but he fights them off. He slays one rat then another, the great Broodmother reeling from the wounds in its side. For a moment you think the rat catcher may single handedly slay the beast but then he slips. Hands slick with blood Sedric loses his grip on the embedded knife and falls from the Broodmother flank, a torrent of rats following after. You rush forward but as he lands he disappears beneath a wave of rat tails."</string>
    <string name="chp19_22_9__c">"Baring your teeth at the festering monstrosity that looms over you, you vow that the rat catcher's sacrifice would not be in vain."</string>
    <string name="chp19_2_1__c">"Moving through the empty streets, you notice the buildings have a more ornate design than those of Verum. They also appear far more ancient, yet the glass in the windows of these homes is perfectly clear, not warped like those you are used to. Nearly every window you pass is filled with expertly crafted furniture, seemingly untouched by time. 

Looking down a side alley, you can see shapes lying on the ground. You have seen enough bodies to know they are corpses. You knew the city was long dead, but can only wonder why. 

The route finally brings you to the edge of the large chasm you spotted earlier. The crumbling remains of adjacent buildings list over the pit as a cold chill breathes up from the vastness below. Peering into the abyss, you spot caverns and structures in the rockface, almost as if there were a forgotten city hidden beneath the streets of the forsaken kingdom."</string>
    <string name="chp19_2_2__a">"A scream from the rear of the troop column snaps you to attention. Rushing to investigate, you find the rearguard huddled together staring at a small house. At first the soldiers do not respond, seemingly in shock. A slap to the face brings one back to attention and you finally get an answer.

\"It took them,\" the guard tells you. \"Pulled them into that house like they were nothing. It all happened so fast.\" None of the guards are able to explain what it was they saw. Grabbing some torches you search the small home, but find no trace of the squad or whatever took them."</string>
    <string name="chp19_2_2__c">"The city may appear empty, but your instincts tell you something else lurks here and it has everyone on edge. Come nightfall, you suspect it will only get worse.

A slap to the face brings one back to attention and you finally get an answer.

\"It took them,\" the soldier tells you. \"Pulled them into the dark like they were nothing. It all happened so fast.\" The terrified men are unable to explain what it was they saw. Grabbing some torches you search the small home yourselves, but find no trace of the squad or whatever took them.

While the search of the home does not yield any food for sustenance, you do find some old lanterns.

At the end of the avenue, you come to a wide area overgrown by trees and plants. However, these are not the sickly, diseased trees of the Deepwood. They appear 'healthy'. They do not seem to be for harvesting either. These people deliberately encouraged growth in their city for some reason. The oddity of the sight evokes something in you. A feeling of something long lost. You try to put your finger on it but are broken from your reverie as dark shapes catch your eye.

At a distance, in the middle of the planted area, you see what looks like a field of corpses. You knew the city was long dead and, at the sight, wonder why. Suddenly a strange sensation washes over you."</string>

The ornate stone fountain is surrounded by a dozen tiny pedestals, each with a pale orb set on top. Only in the most affluent districts of Cistercia have you seen such places where water is made to flow freely. Moving closer, you see Samil, casually sitting beside one of the pedestals. 

You watch as your dead companion stretches out a skinny finger to touch the orb and it immediately begins radiating a brilliant luminescence of soft warmth upon the area. With a wry smile, he looks into your eyes and pushes the orb from the pedestal. It hits the ground in an explosion of blinding light, stunning and disorienting you. When your vision finally returns, Samil is gone.

Carefully picking up a few of the orbs, you manage to illuminate them by twisting their glass lids. What exactly causes them to emit light is a mystery, but there is clearly something wondrous about this dead city. With enough of these orbs, you should be able to hold back the encroaching shadows. You have no idea how Samil knew about them, but once again, he seemed to appear with help just when you needed it most."</string>

Finally, you catch sight of the red brick building with its huge chimney rising through the mist ahead. Stacks of crates and a few piles of sand are arranged before it, giving you the impression of a banksmith. Only this one is far larger than any you have ever seen. 

Darkness is fast approaching, and your need for additional sources of light is becoming more of a concern. You may be able to find more of the orbs inside, or you could choose the safer option and search outside the brick building.

\"It doesn't burn, my lord,\" a soldier reports. \"The wood, the chairs, the tables, you name it. None of it burns.\" Either by design or by some malefic power, nothing in this city seems to burn. The men are forced to sparingly use the amber torches they have with them for warmth and light. You have enough supplies for tonight, but you will need to find new sources of light and heat before long. 

Bedding down, you close your eyes and try to rest in the fading warmth of your own torch. 

Then the screaming starts.

Springing to your feet, you rush to join the other soldiers streaming out of houses and quickly find some of the troops missing. \"The shadows,\" one guard cries. \"The shadows reached out and took them!\" 

A sinking feeling stirs in your gut. You have been hunted by shadows before. If the dead do not rest easy here, no blade will protect you from them. Light is all you have.

As you kneel to study your map, you hear the first whispers of dissent ripple through the men and are not surprised when a young Captain, a woman by the name of Mylar, approaches with a group of soldiers in tow. \"Commanders. This is unacceptable. We must demand to leave this city at once. You countermanded a direct order from the Raven Spire by entering here, and we shall not follow a suicidal order to cross the city.\" The men nod behind her approvingly as she speaks. 

Questioning an order from a superior is an offense punishable by court martial. In the Deepwood, however, there are no courts and no judges. Only you. You must have the support of the soldiers to succeed, but the situation is delicate. After listening to what she has to say, you slowly rise to your feet.

    <string name="chp1_12_1__a">"Location 12 – The Market

The Market square is filled with vendors hawking wares from carts and tables. The sounds of people shouting and the smell of smoked meats and root vegetables fill the air. Dozens of hunched and tired shoulders make their way from one trade to the next.

You split up and casually shop the meager food supplies while keeping your eyes and ears open."</string>
    <string name="chp1_12_1__c">"After nearly an hour, you regroup. The tales you hear shed some light on the situation if only by the absence of anything specific. No one recalls a killing on this side of town. Everyone is tired. They complain of fearful dreams and eyes in the dark keeping them awake at night. A tinkerer hung himself in his kitchen last week. Many blame the dreams for driving him mad, though others say it is just the way of the world.

A well-tended inn shows promise. Entering, you find an amber fire glowing in the hearth. It is warm, dry and seemingly inviting.

\"Pot's Peace!\" a burly man says smiling. His eyes are slightly distant, revealing that his attitude may come more from a bottle than his heart. \"The yams are fresh and the rum's dark as the Deepwood.\"

A newcomer steps up beside him. \"Things are not fresh just because they are green, Bram, especially if they're supposed to be yellow.\" He turns to you. \"He tries at least and he's not lying about the rum… Greycane,\" the man introduces himself with a nod of deference. \"I am the eyes and ears of this town.\"

\"The mouth, more like,\" Bram offers from behind the bar.

\"I am also the bankroll of this establishment,\" he retorts with a knowing look at Bram.

After a few pleasantries, Greycane leads the conversation around to the question of what he can do for a Free Company in Bastone. Hearing of your hunt, a light appears in his eyes.

\"The Son of Lord Arden's been the talk of the town. Word is he had been frequenting a certain sort of alley being less than noble. That's where they found his seal, the noble crest, bathed in blood. No body. The crust blame the common folk, but I think it's something else and I'm glad Davinish had the forethought to call you in.\""</string>
    <string name="chp1_14_1__a">"Location 14 – The Town Square

Smells of cooking pots and the sound of fervent bartering roll over you. Glancing around, you meet the eyes of the destitute peering from dark alleys and crooked doorways. The square itself seethes with people who retreat to give your party a wide berth when they notice you, creating an island in the roiling sea of bodies.

You come to another area bereft of people. At the heart of the square is a ten foot tall iron post driven permanently into the flagstones. Heavy links hang from welded bolts and a large ring of black soot scores the area at its base. Others you have seen of this kind are made from wood. How many people are they burning to warrant one made from iron?

You canvas the area and discover that this functions as a crossroads between east and west Bastone and it seems no violent deaths have been discovered in West Bastone."</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_1__a">"Location 15 – The Shades

Heading up the street you believe is the right choice, you push through crowds and navigate around huddled clumps of the homeless, squatting toad-like around small fires. The barking of vendors eventually gives way to sobbing and indistinct mewling noises as you enter a series of shadowed alleys. There are fewer and fewer people here and darkness hugs the street as you make your way up a narrowing avenue.

You approach a ragged, cloaked figure as he daubs small, white circles on the wall with paint coated fingers. There are hundreds of them. He does not fully turn, but speaks in creaking tones over his shoulder.

\"Have you seen it? Has it seen you? Do you know the truth the Deepwood brings, as we do?\"

He turns, drawing a sickle from under his cloak. His distant gaze falls on you.

The shadows burst with movement. With your attention drawn to the strange figure, you hadn't noticed the ambush you have walked into.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_4__a">"As the sickle rises, the closest of you casually steps up and backhands the man across the alley. He stumbles, crashing into the far wall and crumples to the ground, sickle clattering in the puddles of the street.

Four or five figures scurry fearfully back into the darkness and limp away, muttering excitedly, \"They know, they know!\"

A quick search through the man's pouch finds a handful of iron."</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_4__c">You vow to be more vigilant in the streets of Bastone as you move on.</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_5__a">"You draw your weapons.

The emaciated man calmly cleans under his fingernails with the point of his sickle.

\"What can you take that the Deepwood hasn't taken from us,\" he snarls, flaring his cloak. \"What can you give us that it hasn't promised?\"

The alley explodes in a clash of weapons and a few distinct sprays of blood. The melee is short. An assailant lies in the gutter and several others have bolted into side passages, one with a pouch in their hand."</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_5__c">Cleaning your weapons, you vow to be more vigilant in the streets of Bastone as you move on.</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_6__a">"Fear is this group's strongest weapon and it finds no purchase on you. Your weapons are already out of their sheathes. Your attackers are unprepared for a retaliation from trained warriors."</string>
    <string name="chp1_15_6__c">"After the first assailant falls under your assault with a wet thud, the others turn and vanish into the city alleyways trailing the words, \"They know!\" as they run.

A quick inspection of the fallen reveals iron has scattered in the mud from a split pouch."</string>

    <string name="chp1_16_1__a">"Location 16 – The Watering Hole

Rain trickles from an ill-hanging sign proclaiming this to be the 'The Watering Hole,' it is an apt name for this place, or at least the last part is. You enter the inn to the sight of gritty faces and dirty mugs. From the look of the men, this must be one of the dives of the Underways workers. You hold out your hand, palm up, giving the 'Pot's Peace' gesture to indicate you want no trouble and make your way to the bar. Eyes flash to the Free Company marks on your wrists as you pass.

You approach the innkeeper and ask what he knows of the deaths. \"I know I'm losing the pool. Jimmy, you're supposed to be dead by now,\" he shouts over your shoulder to a man in the corner. Men chuckle and go back to their drinks. \"Lost three good patrons this month. Randle swears he knows, wait … perhaps you can help that dunce. You wanna know what he knows? He's at the stocks. Try to get him out, will you? He's not a bad kid, just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut round the guards.\""</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_10__c">"Orange flames wreathe the fist-sized stones that burn in the iron brazier. You carefully lift the brazier to the lip of the wall and heave it over. Glowing streaks fill the air as the amber rains down on the man and the pack closing in on him. The brazier strikes the amber with a spark and flames engulf the scene below. White light fills your eyes and you instinctively raise your hands to ward them from the heat. A crack like thunder rolls over you and then recedes. You peer over the wall. Charred, twisted bodies and twitching limbs spew smoke. In the middle, you can make out the guard's body. It was a better way to go than what the rats had planned. At least this was quick.

Descending the rope, you go to inspect the carcasses. Half a dozen are scattered around. They must have been attracted by the corpses, then found their way into the town. Crouching beside one of the hideous things you take a closer look."</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_11__a">"You wipe the ichorous blood from your weapons and kneel over the man's corpse. His throat has been torn out by a rat still twitching at his feet. He had managed to kill it just before the end, a last act of defiance. Nothing more to do for him, you move to one of the rats to investigate.

You note the length of the tail, the color of the teeth and the clawed paws. This was a pup, not full grown. You know rats have dozens of pups…dozens. Where's the mother, though? A woman's scream pierces the Deepwood behind you. You're about to find out."</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_12__a">"The man leans on his sword visibly shaking, then stands straight collecting himself.

\"You saved my life. Thank you.\" The man turns to you as he cleans himself up. \"I am Dane. I, I had to try and save her. Stupid to think I could. There were so many of them. For weeks now they have been throwing bodies off the wall and I was too cowardly to try to stop them. Then they threw her over. She was still alive. I saw her crawling. Then the rats came and dragged her into the trees. She may still be alive. Help me. Help her.\"

You inspect one of the rat corpses as he explains. You note the length of the tail, the color of the teeth and the clawed paws. This was a pup, not full grown.

This must be the woman Dane was looking for. The Broodmother lifts her huge snout, testing the air.

You know you won't be able to find the collector before nightfall but you know exactly where the guards will be. Catching sight of the tower the man told you of, you head for the outer wall.

The weather is worsening and rain runs down the stairway leading up Bastone's outer wall. You ascend the gray stone steps in search of the guards. It does not take long to find them. A squad is hunched around a brazier of slow burning amber, water tapping off their iron pot helms.

You close the distance, shouting through the rain, \"Are you the night watch?\"

\"Who's asking?\" one of them grunts giving you a brief sidelong glance before returning his gaze to the fire. Then he looks back, eyeing the mark on your wrists. Understanding dawns on him, and his eyes widen in fear. He goes to draw his sword as the other four turn to face you."</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_2__c">"Before his blade is fully drawn, the closest of you has his wrist and throat in your hands. You wrench him backwards, forcing him over the parapet. Terror seizes the man as nothing but air and the maw of the Deepwood open up below him. You hold him there and he immediately begins to spill all he knows and more besides. The other guards, shocked, have kept their distance allowing you to take in what he has to say.

\"Alright, alright! There's this corpse collector. It was his idea. He paid us to look the other way. Think we get what we deserve standing on this piss-covered wall? Course we took the iron. There! Over there!\" He points to a crumbling section of the wall. These men have caused what has been happening in this town or have at least been complicit in its suffering.

    <string name="chp1_17_3__a">As the man draws his weapon, the closest of you tries to grab him by the wrist and throat. He wrenches free, and with practised technique the other guards draw their blades too. They attack.</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_3__c">The rain washes their blood over the lip of the wall and down the staircase. The bodies of the guards lay scattered around you. You did not get their confession, but justice was served. Leaving their equipment for the next guards who stand here, you begin to trudge along the wall looking for the place where the bodies were dumped.</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_4__a">"You open your hand showing iron. The squad leader looks at it for a moment, then smirks.

\"Think we'd trust you? You'd kill us the second we talked,\" as he draws his blade. \"Men, bleed 'em.\" Having no choice but to protect their secret, they attack."</string>

You head off towards the section of the wall that the guard leader mentioned."</string>
    <string name="chp1_17_8__a">"You come to a point in the parapet where faint blood stains can be seen on the crenellations. Peering over the wall you find what you have been looking for. At its base are the thick wooden stakes used in all settlements to ward off the denizens of the Deepwood. Among these stakes is also a matted mass of blood soaked grass and earth in the center of which is a small mound of corpses. You imagine these are fresh as this much meat would not last longer than a day in the Deepwood. This flesh pile is what calls the thing or things to the town.

Oddly, you also see a rope hanging down from the parapet. Looking between the branches and limbs of the black trees you make out a figure. What could possess a person to go into the Deepwood alone? You have no time to ponder this as the figure rushes back toward the wall. Then you see them, a pack of giant rats the size of wolves enter your view, galloping across the space. A horde of festering fur and yellow teeth close in on a man in guard's uniform. He won't make it and he knows it. He turns and bellows defiantly at the rats as they hiss back.

The brood is circling him, though, heads low and ready to pounce.</string>
    <string name="chp1_19_1__a">"Location 19 – The Banksmith

You trudge the muddy streets and find the Banksmith. The building is made fully from brick rather than a cobbled clay and timber affair like most of the town. It is large and imposing like the two guards at its entrance. Gamel, the Banksmith, is a broad-shouldered man wearing a woven knot apron of fine leather, highlighted with years of coal and grease. The air in the room moves like murky water, heavy with soot and the smell of the forge. Looking behind the Banksmith, you can see iron ingots stacked high. A considerable wealth.

\"If you need shaping, I can do that. Want to exchange goods, my son Tam would usually take care of you, though I've not seen him today. He's got more fingers for the math,\" says the Banksmith, holding up a hand with only three digits."</string>
    <string name="chp1_19_1__c">The Banksmith wants to talk business and nothing more. As soon as you use words like <i>murder</i>", he suddenly decides another customer is more important so you grudgingly head back out into the rain.

There are five stockades in the circle. Only one is currently occupied. A soggy young man with thick, curly red hair sits dejectedly in the rain. A solitary guard leans under an archway not far off paying little heed.

At the sight of you the man brightens, \"Psst! Hey. Can you help me? Honest, I didn't do nothing. It's the guards: corrupt as witchcraft. Iron's more important than blood to them. You're Free Company, right? You can do what you want. Come on. Just lift that pin and I'll do anything.\"

    <string name="chp1_21_1__c">"Green mud sucks at your boots, every stride a challenge as you trudge through the rain. Your hands grip the thick iron cable of the Wire Road, pulled taut through rings sunken into the trunks of hideous trees. For days now, it has been the only evidence of humanity's existence in the Deepwood.

Clinging to this lifeline has not worked for everyone though. You are one less than when you left Verum. It was nothing any of you saw. Just a thrum on the wire behind you and then a scream disappearing into the dark. The memory is fresh in your mind, but this is not the time to mourn… not here.

As you travel, vines and black tree trunks spattered with sickly pink cysts block your view ahead. Things slither away and rustle through the undergrowth, but they are of little concern. One cannot afford to jump at every noise in this place or else you'd go mad. It is only when the sounds slither towards you that you need to worry.

Relief from walking through this overgrown hell is promised as the huddled profile of the fortress town of Bastone looms in the distance. They are the ones that sent for you. People have been dying here, though not of hunger or of the Deepwood. Those don't leave much of a man when they're done. Something else is happening here. Something that is leaving plenty of bodies. The crumbling city walls tower before you. As you approach them, you spot something laying at their base."</string>
    <string name="chp1_21_2__a">"A driving rain batters the city walls as its ancient gray stones stand in defiance of the Deepwood's reaching limbs and the beasts that stalk beneath them.

The deafening roar of the downpour hinders your ability to detect the sound of any approaching threats. You stay alert, noting the danger.

At the base of the walls you find jumbled piles of branches and bone collected together like nests.

In one of the scattered nests lies a jawbone. Most probably human. Woven into the twigs and branches of another nest is a cracked and broken mask. Feminine in design, the once full face mask of delicate ceramic now lies shattered.

What would a Thracian noblewoman's mask be doing here? The question is left unanswered as a glint catches your eye."</string>
    <string name="chp1_21_2__c">Why would anyone leave something so valuable on this side of the wall?</string>

There is plenty more to do here before nightfall."</string>
    <string name="chp1_22_1__a">"As you approach the thick wooden gate, a small slat slides unevenly open and a weary, coal-caked face peers out.

Moments pass as he eyes you with suspicion taking inventory of your many weapons. Then one of you reveals the mark on your wrist. He grimaces, \"Free Company …eerrr… let me get this open.\"

The slat slams shut and you hear chains strain as a mechanism pulls the gate open, swinging out just wide enough to squeeze through. You move into the gateway passage and find it blocked ahead by an iron portcullis, a second layer of defense creating a quarantine area. In the passage with you is a single table, lit by a foul smelling lantern on the wall. You hand him your papers.

\"I'm sure you know the drill,\" the guard urges as he thumbs through them.

Arms extended out from your sides, he raps against you repeatedly with a short hollow tube of wood. He nods, then sniffs, satisfied you have brought nothing of the Deepwood in with you.

\"You've not come too soon. More bodies last night,\" he says as he moves to the rickety table in the corner to mark more paperwork. \"Papers say you're five.\"

A grim silence from you answers his next question.

\"Right, then. An oath fulfilled I suppose.\" He looks uncomfortably away and motions toward a log book with ink and quill beside it. \"Make your mark.\""</string>
    <string name="chp1_22_2__a">"The guard seals the paper with wax and nods to those outside the portcullis. With a slow grind, the iron gate raises to let you through. You understand your task - find whoever or whatever is responsible for the unexplained deaths. As you step out onto the main thoroughfare of Bastone, a sea of unwashed citizens churn through the mud going about their daily struggle.

\"Welcome to my glorious Bastone,\" a voice chimes from your right.

You all turn to the voice. A street urchin, caked in dirt under an explosion of dark hair, leans nonchalantly against the outer wall.

\"If I hadn't been so clever I might have tried to lighten your pockets. Looks like you're too much for me though, right? You come out of the green all bristling with blades fresh from the wire. Nope, me ma made no fool and that's why I'll let you pass without paying my toll.\"

\"Now, I know what you're thinking, we need that kind of charitable citizen to show us around. Well usually I'd say no, what with all my other responsibilities around town. But for you, I make an exception. 4 iron a day and I make this place feel like home for you.

It is clear you've no more need of muscle, but I've another skill. I can read. That's right. I stand before you as scout, guide, scholar and sage.\"

Midge pushes his way between you to block your way to the center of town. \"Also there may be four of you but I think you need another pair of eyes,\" he grins and shows a spread of four iron coins in his hand. \"You should really take more care with these.\" He holds out the money to you. \"See, I told you you'd not pay my toll,\" he says as he hands them back. \"So, do we have a deal then?\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp1_22_5__a">"\"Inn, tavern, or pub?\" Midge grins. You're not sure what the difference is between the last two, but correct his expectations and explain that you need to know more about the bodies.

He shrugs, \"Been nasty. They've been finding bodies and bits of bodies all over the slums for weeks now. Nobody does nothing until a noble was found dead and scattered about an alley.\"

Realization widens in his eyes. \"Are you them, then? The Oathsworn?\"

You nod and Midge grimaces. \"Bugger, we didn't agree no hazard pay.\"

Ignoring the boy's comment you begin to question him about the town. He tells you of various locations and you begin to form a plan for the hunt. Bastone has many of the usual landmarks and there is a Banksmith and Apothecary to trade with for the supplies you may need for what is to come."</string>

\"Burning's expensive though. Hard to find people to go out to the Deepwood and cut the wood. Especially after that lot didn't come back.

You find the town archives and an irksome clerk named Millus. \"The deaths, I presume,\" the clerk says dismissively. \"I suppose you should follow me then. Everything is collected. You will not find our numbers wanting. Move nothing!\"

The records Millus helps you sort through deal with a large list of missing persons, a pile dedicated to what appear to be suicides, and a tally of the local dead with the cause of death inked beside each name. The details are grisly, and some descriptions have no names attached where only bits of bodies and blood trails were all that remained, yet left no doubt that there was a killing.

\"I don't know why you bother with the peasantry and their ilk. Their numbers wax and wane like the sun,\" he says derisively. \"What should be of concern is my timber figures. Nine cords of wood marked used last month for various reasons. Mostly funerals. But records show only seven cords being pulled in. Two cords unaccounted for. What is this world coming to? Either the gatekeepers are not doing their job or someone's lying, and there's nothing worse than lying on a census. That's the real crime here!\"

You have heard there is an Apothecary of sorts in this quarter, situated on the rooftop of a tenement. When you arrive you find a stand-alone shack surrounded by gardens and a queue of people.

Forcing your way to the door you enter and find a room which is something between a library, a curiosity shop and a vegetable stand. A young woman is hunched over a man sitting on a stool, tending a wound.

\"Wait your turn,\" the woman says angrily without looking up. When you make no move to leave, she wheels on you, then stops.

A moment of panic crosses her face, but she quickly rights herself, \"Oathsworn…You'd better be dying or know someone who's dying to barge in like this…\"

You assuage her concerns and tell her you want to know about the rising body count in the town. \"Well I wouldn't know about that. The dead don't tend to come to me for pulses, now do they?\"

\"No survivors?\" you ask.

\"None that I heard of. Not that I go looking. I've got enough to handle here with the living.\" She turns back to the man on the stool. As she does, a rock crashes through the lone window in the room, showering it with glass.

\"You killed my Da!! You Witch!\" Comes a small boy's voice from outside. \"She cursed him, I saw it!\" This is followed by the sound of small feet running away across the rooftop.

The apothecary is visibly shaken. You ask her what that was about, but she busies herself picking up glass and refuses to talk any further. If she knew anything, she was not forthcoming about it and will be less so now."</string>

And another. One turns towards you and hisses … you strike your flint.

You know this as you can see the treeline of the Deepwood through a hole where a solitary foundation stone has somehow shifted out of place. Blood stains highlight the opening on all sides, concentrating on this point, as if bodies or body parts have been forced through the gap.

\"He's not alone you know? The rat that bit that arm.\" You turn, listening to the ratcatcher.

Something large moves and you crouch to watch. Sedric stifles an excited laugh. The rat has a silhouette the size of a wolf, but low and barrel-like with a smell of rot emanating from it. It has not seen you yet, and in the hopes of keeping it that way, one of you draws a blade and lashes out, burying it deep into the thing's skull. It was a solid kill, but as the hissing sound rises around you, you realize it was futile.

The Deepwood bursts with vile life as the hulking ratlike form of the Broodmother parts the branches to your side. Her back undulates with rats that swarm around her as she lifts her huge snout, testing the air. Her great head of rotten fur and gnawing teeth rolls towards you and, with a ravenous hunger, her eyes meet yours."</string>

Using the information you have gathered, and with the help of a couple of street urchins from the east side, you find the spot where the Noble was killed.

You walk the shady alley. Even the drunk and dying avoid the end of this street. Bloodstains still spatter the walls, the rain running down them having little effect on the marks. You search the area for something to help in your task."</string>
    <string name="chp1_4_2__a">"Your eyes follow trickling water down the walls, watching as it gathers in the gutters then runs toward a nearby sewer covered with a hatch. Curious.

    <string name="chp1_4_3__a">The blood seems sprayed in every direction and anything else of use has been washed away or taken. Even what remains of a murder has value in these streets.

    <string name="chp1_4_4__a">"You squeeze through the hatch into a dark maze of rough-hewn passages, your torches glowing pale blue in the noxious air. Ankle-deep in waste and muck, you slog through winding tunnels, kicking aside rats and brushing away cobwebs, looking for any clue as to what might be behind this.

Around one corner you stop. There is a splashing. A thick heavy motion lumbers toward you from a shadowy side passage. Sounds of chittering and nervous clicking conjure memories of past ambushes prompting each of you to draw your weapons.

Whatever it is, it is low and hunched. This is no rat. This is something much larger and it's moving fast."</string>
    <string name="chp1_4_5__a">"Before it is even clearly in the light, practiced moves see your weapons passing through the approaching mass. There is a wailing scream.

You step back to see what your handiwork has brought.

A filthy man.

A ratcatcher, by the look of his gear, lays at your feet. He was not what you were looking for.

The body stops twitching as you clean your weapons. Not your finest moment but there is no room for guilt here. A rapid search of the corpse reveals nothing of value.

Faces stern, you press on."</string>
    <string name="chp1_4_6__a">"As it scampers closer, you can make out a hunched mass of ragged hair. You ready your weapons at the approach.

As it enters the flickering light from your torches, a man's face emerges. A ratcatcher from the look of him.

You!\" He shouts, \"Have you seen it?\" He notices your weapons drawn. \"You have! Good! Come, you must see this.\" He turns, but then cautiously looks back.

\"Don't eat any of the rats. They're mine,\" he glares, showing broken teeth.

At that, he scurries off the way he came at a surprising speed.

It's not much but it is the only thing you have. You follow.

The little man is fast and, in this confined space, it is difficult to keep up."</string>
    <string name="chp1_4_7__a">You wade through the muck trying to pick up a trail. The sewers are a labyrinth of criss-crossing tunnels. More than once, things bite at you from beneath the water and at one point a swarm of small dark shapes descend upon you.</string>

You wonder how this could smell worse than the passages you were just in. The ratcatcher is scrabbling through one of the piles then rises, wielding something over his head. You realize it's a dismembered arm.

\"Look at the bites here. See? Rats. The hand is calloused. A farmer, my guess. From the Underways. Mushrooms and roots. His nails, long and chipped. Good digger. Two things I know are men and rats, but never nothing like this…\" he turns the arm over and puts his finger deep into a blackened wound.

\"The tooth that bit this arm…\"

He looks at you with a serious glare and holds his thumb and forefinger six inches away from each other. You ask him if he knows where the rat came from.

He looks up at you almost excited. He nods, \"Let Sedric join the great hunt and I'll take you.\"

Ancient wooden doors mark the entrance to the underways below the city. Inside, looming passages of moist soil, well timbered up and tended, lead ever downward. Women with tied back hair carry buckets of roots or yokes of water on their shoulders as men work the dark loam, sweating in the dull glow of amber lanterns.

\"I know my workers and you are not them,\" an authoritative female voice announces. It is a slight woman with bright eyes, dressed in a man's leather farm clothes. She points at your wrists fearlessly. \"Oathsworn. Good. Let's make this fast. I am Celeste. Overseer.\"

You explain why you are here. She takes it in and replies, \"Nothing amiss down here, yeah, in the past three months. I have lost four, but that has all been above ground. Suicide? Witches? Whatever else stalks the damned streets above. You tell me. I have my men leave in pairs now. No one walks alone upside. Only fool runners like Randle do that. And I've not seen him.

When you arrive back at Bastone, you are met by a squad of guards.

\"Our Lord Davenish heard of your foray into the Deepwood. Have you found the beast?\" says the Sergeant.

You raise the severed head of the Broodmother to the guard's face. The men recoil.

\"Well… well done. I have been instructed to give you this iron in payment and to tell you that Lord Davenish would meet with you tomorrow morning. He has paid for your lodgings at The Broken Oak Inn during your stay. I would suggest retiring there now as his lordship will not suffer tardiness tomorrow.\"

No one needs to say what this defense means…they know. This will not be a fight that you can win. The mission is to buy enough time for the pyre to be completed and for The Keening to draw the monsters from the Heart of Darkness. There is no more time for big speeches. No more time for a grand gesture. As you make your way to the battlements you nod to those you pass and know that it will be the last time you see most of them.</string>

The healer has been overworked these last few days, mending wounds and administering the Faith. As you pass by, the man asks if he may provide you a healing prayer to help prepare you for the coming battle. Although you can surely use any extra bit of help, you also know the effort will sap much of Finnian's remaining strength and could jeopardize his ability to keep some of the soldiers alive if casualties are high.

Word of what transpired in the forsaken city as well as the details of the landscape and beasts surrounding Raven's Reach is critical information.

Seeing the young boy is still unconvinced, you try a different approach, reminding him of someone important back in Verum whose life hangs in the balance, the Mute Boy. Tears stream down Midge's dirty cheeks as the realization dawns on him and he finally agrees.

Misty wraith-like ribbons of green, blue, and purple dance and conspire overhead, casting a soft, foreboding glow upon the valley below, yet somehow bolstering the darkness where shadows lurk. This should not be. The phenomenon - predating recorded history itself - has come far too early, a bad omen to those who deal in superstition.

Standing on the ramparts of Raven's Reach, you can hear the sound of beasts in the distance, like a rising storm. The Broodmother had been just the first of them. More are coming. Many more. It is as though the whole Deepwood moves to thwart your efforts, an intense focus on you that seems to come from all around. You are not welcome here. Your intrusion into the Deepwood's heart will not be tolerated. 

Shaking your head to clear it, you remind yourself of your mission. Perform The Keening, draw the monsters from the Heart of Darkness and get inside. The last chance of Verum lies within. The Keening needs to happen now.

Dark clouds gather above and a heavy rain soon follows. You have precious little time to prepare. Defenses must be bolstered and the pyre must be built before The Keening can commence. As you distribute tasks to your soldiers, a blinding flash of lightning streaks across the sky, silhouetting a dark figure perched on the eyrie of the fort's central tower. Small, brilliant eyes glare at you through the darkness as a second bolt of lighting strikes overhead, illuminating what appears to be a short beak jutting from the figure's head. An Avi. 

Suddenly, a voice registers in your mind, feminine and grim, \"The Darkness calls your name. We hear it also. As above, so below. The end of paths draws near, where madness is reason, and reason is madness. Darkness or Death will be your choice, and your choice will it be. No other's. Choose wisely, Marked Ones, for the world turns on it.\"

Thoughts swirl in your mind as you send voiceless words in reply to the Avi, demanding she speak plainly and explain what choice she refers to. Fierce, avian eyes peer back with deep knowing.

\"If you were told, there would be no choice. And without choice, all becomes nothing,\" the Avi silently replies, gesturing her long arms wide to the world. 

In the beat it takes to share a look with your companions, the Avi disappears into the night."</string>
    <string name="chp20_0_2__a">While your kin was speaking to your companions, you were able to commune with her and glean additional insight. Like you, the Avi is a disciple of the Ory, whose translation of the sacred Eschaton set you on this path long ago.

The other two witches offer no resistance as you bind them to the post. The man from Cistercia only stares sullenly at the pyre as you secure him. Still under the effects of the Aether, the witch from Thrace requires little effort to secure. She is placid now but you had to give her your last dose of Aether back in the forbidden city. You can only hope it holds her under long enough. 

As the pyre continues to take shape, the reality of the moment strikes you. Until now, The Keening had only been a distant task waiting at the end of a long line of other events. The terrible choice pushed back as you had always hoped another way would be found. That somehow it would not come to this. However, staring at the pyre before you, you realize you are out of time.

The terrible choice pushed back as you had always hoped another way would be found. That somehow it would not come to this. However, staring at the pyre before you, you realize you are out of time. The myriad choices are collapsing to a single question. Could you sacrifice one to save many? You will need to decide soon."</string>
    <string name="chp20_0_9__a">"A horrifying screech bellows in the distance, pulling you from your thoughts. You have counted the seconds since the last cries of the horde were heard, and they are drawing closer. Fast. 

The swarm will be massive, far larger than the one that pushed you into the forbidden city. At least you have a fort to protect you this time, though it is old and crumbling. Hopefully it will hold them off long enough for the pyre to be completed."</string>
    <string name="chp20_0_9__c">"As you listen, an officer salutes you. You had sent his men to scout the fort for any remaining dangers and to get a lay of the land.

He begins by telling you that the outer walls had once been impressive defenses. They have been weathered by time and the Deepwood, but they should hold as long as you properly man them and there are no breaches elsewhere. At this point, you are thankful for any strong stones standing between you and the Deepwood. 

He continues by telling you of two large towers that stand vigil above the outer bailey, one of which is equipped with fat bronze tubes, aimed at the edge of the treeline. These must have been some sort of powerful weapon used to keep the beasts away from the walls. The second tower will provide the perfect lookout spot for your soldiers as its height offers unobstructed views of the fortress' perimeter, allowing them to see where creatures are approaching from.

He then points out that the inner bailey contains an armory and an old stable. The armory has collapsed, however, but with a little scavenging you may find something useful within. 

He finishes by telling you of the only serious weakness in your defenses, a large tunnel burrowed beneath the fortress wall. He surmises it is the breach which brought about the fall of Raven's Reach long ago. Thanking the officer, you order his soldiers to set up an improvised alert system within the tunnel using scraps of old weapons and armor. Hopefully it will help you detect if something infiltrates through there."</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_1__a">A sound like thunder rumbles off in the distance. The first attack wave is nearly upon you. And many more will follow. There are several locations which must be defended and you are all that stands between the creatures and The Keening. No matter the cost, you must prevail.</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_1__c">According to the reports from your scouts, the first attack will come from the NORTH. You will need to defend that side of the fortress as well as the BASTIONS.</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_2__a">"Wave 1: Assault 1

With the troops deployed, you take your positions and wait for the attack. The Deepwood has suddenly fallen silent, with the pregnant pause that precedes every battle. It begins with a soft, cool breeze and rustling from the underbrush. Then, in an explosion of horror, you watch the woods come alive. Dark shapes burst forth in a storm of claws, tentacles and gleaming teeth dripping with acid and saliva."</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_3__a">Wave 1: Assault 2</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_4__a">"Wave 1: Assault 3

The soldiers hold as well as they can - these men and women fighting with ferocity to match the creatures they face. Another assault comes, and while you can tell there are more coming from the Depths of the Deepwood, your scouts tell you there will be some breathing room after the next assault."</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_5__a">You have survived the first wave, but you know the attacks will only increase in strength. Shouting out commands, you urge the soldiers to fight on and to keep building the pyre.</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_6__a">The soldiers assigned to the Armory search through the rubble for anything that may be useful in the ongoing siege.</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_7__a">A mob of creatures has breached the defenses and reached the pyre where only a few soldiers stand between them and your last hope.</string>
    <string name="chp20_1_8__a">Without hesitation, you order a small contingent of soldiers to reinforce the pyre. The troops fight hard, sacrificing their lives to preserve the mission, for at least a while longer.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_10__a">You have turned back another wave of monsters. A quick peek at the work on the pyre tells you progress is slow, but steady.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_11__a">The soldiers you assigned to the Armory continue to search for anything of use.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_12__a">The creatures have broken through and reached the pyre. Only a few soldiers stand between them and your last hope.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_13__a">You quickly order additional troops to the pyre, knowing you are sending them to their deaths. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_1__a">A sea of green stretches from horizon to horizon as you stand on the ramparts. With a sharp eye and keen ear, you try to glean an indication of where the next attack will come from.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_2__a">The driving rain makes it difficult to see, but you can tell the areas to the West and North West are utterly still and quiet. No assault will come from either of those directions. Suddenly, you hear a loud rattling from the tunnel below.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_3__a">The areas to the West and North West are utterly still and quiet, no assault will come from there. But when you look to the North East, you see dark shapes moving between the trees. An assault from that direction is likely. You can also hear a loud rattling from the tunnel below, yet another point they will try to exploit. You do not have all the information, but you must make do with what you have.</string>

But when you look to the North East, you see numerous dark shapes moving between the trees.

As if that were not enough, you can also hear a loud rattling from the tunnel below, yet another point they will try to exploit.</string>
    <string name="chp20_2_5__a">The driving rain makes it impossible to see. All around the fortress, the trees sway listlessly, whether it is from the wind or the stirring of the creatures beneath them is difficult to tell.

    <string name="chp20_3_10__a">"Wave 3: Assault 5

At the edge of your vision, you catch sight of a massive beast charging for the Left Bastion. Lesser monsters are turned into wet crimson puddles beneath its stampeding tread as each giant footfall brings it closer to the fortress' ancient walls."</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_11__a">"Wave 3: Assault 6

Bloodied in body and weapons, it feels as if the assault will never end. There is no telling if your defenses can survive another attack of this scale. You need to finish the pyre soon."</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_12__a">"As you hear the dying screams of the remaining beasts outside the fortress walls, you suddenly feel the ground shake yet again. Turning toward the pyre, you see waves of force rolling out from beneath the Thracian Witch. She is waking. 

Snapping into action with the butt of your weapon, you render the woman unconscious once more. She is growing more powerful. You must perform The Keening as soon as possible."</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_13__a">"As the last beast falls, you suddenly feel the ground rumbling once again. With no creature in sight, you turn toward the pyre and see the Thracian Witch standing next to the burning post, slowly raising her arms as waves of force roll out from beneath her. She is awake! 

The soldiers in the courtyard quickly scramble up the pyre to subdue the witch. One of the guards leaps for her. She stops the man midair with a gesture, holding him aloft for a moment, before sending him flying across the courtyard with a wave of her hand, smashing him into a nearby wall."</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_13__c">The distraction allows another guard an opportunity to get behind her and deliver a blunt blow to the back of her head with the butt of his sword.

    <string name="chp20_3_16__a">A mob of beasts has broken through. They roar in unison as they charge the pyre, crashing into the small squad of troops defending it.</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_17__a">Sending men to their deaths is never easy, but it must be done if you hope to execute The Keening. Turning to a nearby squad, you send them to defend the pyre.</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_1__a">Your numbers are steadily dwindling and you can no longer defend the entire fortress. It is critical for you to determine where the next attack will come from if you hope to survive.</string>
    <string name="chp20_3_2__a">"With each creature slain, the Deepwood seems to grow more and more alive. You can see the branches of the cursed trees bending, reaching out for the walls, hungry for blood. Everywhere you look, creatures stalk the shadows, waiting for a chance to strike. 

From your vantage point, it seems the North East is quieter than the North West. Aside from that, it is clear the next assault will come from everywhere else. 

As you redeploy your troops to better defend against the next wave, a soldier by the pyre calls out to you, \"Sir! The Thracian witch! She is waking up!\"

    <string name="chp21_1_11__a">"Terrifying hallucinations assault your mind, the haunting delusions threaten to drive you mad. Anxiety and hopelessness fester and grow until… the words of your Oath come to mind once more.

We shall not break.

We join the line.

We answer the call.

We will stand and die.

Yet death will know our name.

We are Oathsworn.

Twenty six words that now define you. Together they draw you back to the surface and you gulp air. The tunnel is as it was, the vision passing. As you look ahead, the tunnel has come to an end and a vast cavern now lies before you."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_1__a">"The witch's wailing scream chases you through the tunnel beneath Raven's Reach, blurring your vision and making each step a feat of balance. The Keening has worked as you had hoped and every monster within reach of her deathcry has come to its call. You can hear the clawing and heavy tread of the beasts above over the ear-splitting shriek. 

A short distance into your trek, you hack at the support beams that hold open the passageway, to seal off any pursuing creatures. Tons of rock and dirt crash down, and at the last moment you see a wolf-like creature, which had been silently stalking your escape, swallowed by the rubble. A rare stroke of luck. You know there is precious little time left before the effects of The Keening wear off, and quickly resume your search for the tunnel exit.

Traveling through the forgotten passage, you find dozens of rotten corpses - the last human defenders of Raven's Reach. The tomb is a treasure trove of ancient armor and finely smithed weapons. You take a moment to make sure you are as well armed as possible. You know you will need to be where you are going."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_2__a">"Ahead, a pinprick of light finally guides you toward an exit into the Deepwood. Emerging, you turn to look back at the fallen fortress. You can no longer hear the Thracian Witch's screams, yet a sea of flesh and fur and bone continues to wash over the crumbling stone walls, clawing and snapping at one another in a desperate attempt to answer The Keening's summons. Somehow its effects have not yet worn off. Still, the beasts howl and cry out in a cacophony of death that words cannot describe. Suddenly, there is a clap of thunder and you see a line of trees in the distance topple over as the Doom of Bastone emerges. Its storm gray form barrels through the fortress' eastern wall, pulverizing defenses which had stood for untold ages. With the gargantuan beast's appearance here, you know the way is clear into the Heart of Darkness. You must move now!

Hurrying through the Deepwood, the sound of Raven Reach's deathknell is muffled by the thick, sickening trees, and you are afforded a rare moment of peaceful respite. Just days ago, nearly three hundred soldiers departed Verum, and now only you - a single Free Company - are all that remains. One Free Company, and one last chance. 

A few hundred yards later, you arrive at a small clearing and see the Heart of Darkness before you, like a black scar gouged into the earth. Sharp pains begin to stab along the length of your arms as you approach the deadly cavern. As you look down at them, you find the black spots on your skin have begun to sprout and spread. Somehow this place seems to be hastening the effects of the plague. You have seen what befalls those in the later stages of the disease, and the thought sickens you. You feel weak and drained of hope, but you know you must find a way to hold it together long enough to complete your mission."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_3__a">"Standing at the precipice of the cavern entrance, you share a look with your companions. There is no turning back, not for any of you now. Verum's survival is in your hands. Lighting your amber torches, you take your first steps into the Deepwood's heart.

Your torches barely hold back the encroaching dark. What little illumination you have falls upon a path of overgrown roots and jagged hunks of amber buried in the dense soil. The walls are close and the atmosphere is thick. You struggle to force enough air into your lungs as you slash and hack at the labyrinth of undergrowth slowing your advance."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_4__c">With grim determination, you push through the endless thicket. Swing after swing only reveals more roots and vines as it starts to feel like you are digging your own grave.</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_5__a">Your arms soon grow weak from the endless hacking and it feels like the Deepwood means to bury you down here. Drawing on what little strength you have left, you continue to push further in.</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_6__a">"Going deeper, the tunnel gets tighter and tighter, and where you could walk shoulder to shoulder before, you are now forced into single file. The fetid air gets thicker still and a grogginess clouds your mind. As the world judders and your vision swims, a scuffling noise catches your attention. As you raise your torch to look ahead, the darkness disgorges terror. Fiends you have fought and things you have only seen in your nightmares, slither and crawl toward you. Looking at your skin, you see every wound and scar you have ever suffered split open, tearing your flesh anew and spilling your lifeblood upon the earth. Your attempts to fell the creatures are useless as your weapons pass cleanly through them. They appear by the hundreds and within moments, the darkness envelops you.

In the black, an ethereal weightlessness takes hold. Memories swirl in your mind. 

You are already dead. Your funeral was long ago. The night before you set out on the Wire to take the Oath, a pyre was lit for you. There you cut all ties and bonds to your old life and took on the name of 'aspirant'. You spent a day and a night in the Deepwood to get to the Oathstone. The journey that kills so many did not deter you and you found the stone circle. There HE waited for you and an Oath was spoken."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_7__c">"You shake yourself out of it. This is just an illusion, a nightmare. Whatever force is at play here, you will not let it master you. The words that were spoken on the day you took the Oath resound in your head like the drumbeat of war, giving you clarity and purpose.

Today you take your stand.

Today you join the line.

The first and last line.

The line of the glorious dead.

None have broken it.

Will you be the first?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_8__a">"Panic rises, threatening to overwhelm you. But as the madness wraps its icy fingers around your mind, the words of the Oath resound in your head like the drumbeat of war, giving you clarity and purpose.

Today you take your stand.

Today you join the line.

The first and last line.

The line of the glorious dead.

None have broken it.

Will you be the first?

No, you will not be the first. This is just an illusion, a nightmare. Whatever force is at play here, you will not let it master you."</string>
    <string name="chp21_1_9__a">"Returning to your senses, you exchange a look with your companions. It seems everyone experienced the same vision. Without speaking a word, you continue down the tunnel. After a time, its descent becomes extremely steep, and an even thicker growth of roots and vines bars your way. There is no choice to make here. No left or right, only forward, deeper into the claustrophobic passageway. 

A terrible feeling of sickness and corruption washes over you, the world suddenly twisting away. The walls begin to close in around you as roots reach out to bind your arms and squeeze your chest, slithering into your eyes and mouth. You can feel the diseased tree inside you, crushing and choking, strangling you from within."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_10__a">\"It is pitiful how oblivious your kind are, fumbling around in the dark, unable to look up into the light,\" Samil says with a sneer. \"It was not always so. You have forgotten the true way of things. The Animus responds to the call of your will. A sea with its own currents, a realm with its own laws, where the great tide of possibility crashes against the shores of expectation. A reality where unbounded choice reigns over all. The secret to the veil, the key to life again. All is prepared for you, the door cannot be opened from within but you can open it from without.</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_11__a">"Samil smiles, shrugging his shoulders. \"Perhaps you were the smartest? The bravest? The strongest? Perhaps you earned your way here, proved yourself worthy? Or perhaps it is as simple as you are the only ones to ever reach this place?\"

His evil eyes watch and wait menacingly above a sinister grin. \"No,\" he replies at last. \"I brought you here through death and disease, saving your life time and again for one reason. I have seen who you are. And I know you will make the right choice.\""</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_12__a">\"I am sure you are aware by now that the plague is connected to Kharnus, and Kharnus to it. He has power over all flora and fauna in the Deepwood, but I have never been able to direct his madness or control humans. And so, with some help, a solution was discovered to remedy this limitation. The results have been far more encouraging than they had hoped for. After all, they can be quite inventive in their own ways. You see, another party is terribly interested in your little cities. It just so happened their desires served my purposes. Madness has its uses as you can see, but it is only malice that can create the suffering I seek. Alas, let none of this concern you. You will not live long enough to meet them.\"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_13__a">"Samil's smile wavers as he considers you more carefully. \"Ah, you see! That is why I like you. Always searching for the advantage. The creatures do not answer my call,\" he says, looking to the great A'Dendri. \"But I have learned to ride his madness and even steer its course on occasion. I suppose I could give it a try on your behalf. After all, it would be a waste to have had you come all this way only to die before you could make the most important choice of your life.\"

Samil closes his eyes, and you see the creatures lurking in the shadows start to quiver as if struggling to resist their own will and instinctive desires. Samil appears to strain under the effort when suddenly, his eyes open again. \"There. I have bought you a bit more time. Use it wisely, Oathsworn.\""</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_14__a">"\"As I said, I am not myself, nor am I the man you see before you. A veil is drawn between us. If you truly wish to know me, then you need only choose to release me. In that moment, all will be revealed. I promise you, I do not speak falsely when I say I am your salvation.\"

Whoever Samil is, he is clearly not telling you all he knows. The 'rules' of this choice may force him to tell the truth but that does not seem to compel him to reveal everything."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_15__a">\"Always thinking of the challenge ahead like the good soldiers you are,\" Samil offers with an arrogant sense of pride. \"Well, he is all around you. The pillars, the vines and the very walls in this cavern are all him. Nowhere is safe, the trees least of all. You would be wise to keep your distance from his spores and be ready to move when you enrage him, for that is when they will be thickest. But most importantly of all, know he will be at his most dangerous when injured. Try not to spend yourselves too quickly.\"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_16__a">"\"Ah, the right question,\" he smiles. \"You came here searching for an end to the plague, but I can offer you a far greater prize.\" Samil steps closer, his face inches from your own. \"If you release me, you will bring an end to the Deepwood itself.\" A wide grin spreads across his sinister face, letting the revelation hang in the fetid air. 

\"You see, I am imprisoned inside our slumbering friend here,\" he continues. \"Yet, with just one simple death, I can be set free. His death. Kill Kharnus. Set me free. Without him, the plague will lose its potency and the Deepwood's expansion will cease. You will save your city and its people. The world could be reclaimed and I will walk it once more, free of my bonds.\" A look of intense satisfaction crosses Samil's face. He did not explain who it would be who reclaimed the world.

\"Of course, you must give your own lives to set me free,\" he continues nonchalantly. \"But you already know that, don't you?\" 

He is right. There is no scenario where you envision walking out of this alive. In fact, the moment you contracted the plague, a part of you heard the bell toll in the distance. Now, it thunders in your ears."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_17__a">\"Death,\" Samil answers matter of factly. \"Yours and countless others. The Plague will ravage your city and the Deepwood will gorge itself on the husk. And you… you will never leave this place. Thousands of hungry mouths, desperate to satisfy themselves on your flesh, are clawing their way through the tunnel as we speak. I will not be able to hold them off much longer, and there is no other way to escape this tomb except through them.\"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_19__a">"The roar of the horde of beasts stampeding down the tunnel grows louder. Rushing to the cavern entrance, you desperately hack at the stone and dirt and roots, collapsing the tunnel and sealing yourself inside. You have managed to buy yourselves some time. Suddenly, a boulder-sized fist smashes into the ground behind you and a mouthless roar rattles your bones. Kharnus, the father of the A'Dendri and creator of the Deepwood, driven mad and sealed within this living tomb for hundreds of years, awakens! 

\"Your moment has arrived, Oathsworn,\" Samil shouts. \"Will you kill Kharnus and release me, beginning the end of the Deepwood and the death of the plague? Or will you refuse and die, dooming your city just to keep me locked in this prison?\"

\"You see, it was always about you!\" Samil says, looking right at you. \"Sitting at that table week after week. Your choices forming this world, every choice leading you here. Now it is time. Will you open the last mystery? Will you release me…release me…RELEASE ME…\"

Samil's words boom through the cavern, shifting and warping the very fabric of reality. The walls appear to stretch and twist as you desperately search for more options than the one Samil presents. You find none. 

Kharnus writhes in torment, fighting his bonds and clawing at the floor, desperate to free himself. You are out of time. Death is always a certainty, that is the lot of all Oathsworn. All that matters now is making it a good one.

An opportunity to end the plague and destroy the Deepwood lies before you. All you must do is kill Kharnus. But in doing so, you will unleash whatever Samil is into the world. Something primal in you warns against this, yet, could you lose Verum to stop him? He is clearly a being of immense power. If, with one lie, he could cause the breaking of the world, what would he be capable of free of his bondage? Could losing Verum mean saving the rest of the world? You look into Samil's eyes, seeking any sign of humanity, some reason to console you if you chose to free him, but he is not hiding himself from you now. His eyes are black pits and in them you see only death staring back at you.

The cavern falls silent as the world teeters on a knife's edge.


Choose. One. Last. Time!"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_1__a">"You step into a massive domed cavern of packed earth and roots. Great pillars as thick as Deepwood trees rise from the floor and mingle with a dense network of vines which support the ceiling. A soft amber glow runs through their veins, tracing the walls of the cavern and running along the ground. The amber light pulses with the rhythm of a heart beating deep beneath the earth. This is the epicenter of the tunnel system, the Heart of Darkness.

Further in, you sense something moving. Something big. You cautiously advance, holding your torches high to glean a clearer view ahead. What you see stops you in your tracks.

Partially submerged in the earth, and bound to the cavern walls by dozens of thick pulsing roots, slumbers a colossal being. The massive figure judders and writhes as though afflicted by nightmares. The portion of the creature not buried below the earth must be twice as large as anything you have ever faced. It was clearly an A'Dendri once, though it has now swollen to gigantic proportions. Warped and twisted, every root and vine in the cavern leads back to this creature, forming its own prison. Finally, jutting from its chest is a huge amber boulder which pulses in synchrony with the veins on the walls. Looking closely, you see something move beneath its glassy orange surface.

\"Magnificent, isn't he?\" an all-too-familiar voice asks. Turning with a start, you find Samil at your side, staring up at the slumbering giant. Turning your weapons to him, Samil merely smiles. \"Please. After all we've been through together?\" he smirks, walking through your weapons as though they are not there. \"You won't be needing those… not yet anyway. You must first learn why you wield them. Everything must happen in its proper time.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_20__c">"You utter a single word, \"Yes.\"

A smile slowly stretches across Samil's face, wider than any human should be capable of. An evil, rumbling laugh begins to rise from everywhere at once. Samil's eyes never leave yours as he slowly fades from sight. 

The Mad Dreamer, Kharnus, roars in defiance. Thrashing from side to side, he yanks at the great vines tethering him to the earth. It is as though he is aware of your decision and wishes to deny you. The thick vines chaining his right arm suddenly snap. He is breaking free! Towering before you, the great antlered head of Kharnus rolls forward, fixing his large, mad eyes upon you. The time has come to fulfill your Oath."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_21__c">"The word issues firm and true from your lips, \"No.\"

Samil shakes with rage, pure hatred consuming his visage. You have dedicated your life to putting fiends and horrors into the ground, you will not allow this one to escape it. You feel it in your bones, Samil is too dangerous. 

The weight of your choice is not lost on you. The hope of thousands of lives had been snuffed out by it. But that is your burden to carry, your responsibility. One that is heavier than death itself. Verum may fall, but other cities will still survive. People have survived a thousand years of the Deepwood and could do so a thousand more. Looking into Samil's eyes, however, you see no future at all. All could be lost if he were to be freed. Samil bellows a deep, rage-filled roar, railing against the eons he has spent in his prison. As the cavern shakes, Samil slowly fades from sight, his hate-filled eyes never leaving yours. 

The Mad Dreamer, Kharnus, roars in his madness. Thrashing from side to side, he yanks at the great vines tethering him to the earth. He will surely destroy you in this confined space and your choice means you cannot kill him. The moment has come to finally face your own death, to lay down your arms in this unmarked grave deep beneath the earth. Then you see it. As Kharnus swings his mighty fists wildly about, he smashes the cavern wall, sending great clods of earth and stone to the ground. Your eyes dart to the tree-like pillars that support the roof and a realization hits you. If you cannot kill him, the next best option is to bury him. If you can injure the ancient A'Dendri lord enough, in his rage, he may bring the entire cave down on top of himself. You will bury yourselves along with him, but at least this sacrifice would stop anyone else from being drawn here by Samil. You could seal his prison for good. 

The thick vines chaining Kharnus' right arm suddenly snap. He is breaking free! Towering before you, the great antlered head of Kharnus rolls forward, fixing his large, mad eyes upon you. The time has come to fulfill your final Oath."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_2__a">"Returning his gaze to the massive being, Samil speaks with a soft smile, \"Poor thing. He was once the father of an entire people. A king losing a war against the treekillers. He wished to defeat his enemies. So, I told him how. I was but a whisper when he first came to me. Nothing more than a worm in the ear. I gave him what he asked for. Though not quite the way he had intended.\" A smile broadens on Samil's face as he turns to you. \"Now he is the father of a much greater kingdom,\" he says, raising his hands to gesture at the entirety of the Deepwood.

You remember the tale you read in the Watcher's journal. The story of the war with the A'Dendri over the 'Life Giver'. It said the A'Dendri were losing that war when the madness came, wiping out their city and in its death throes the Deepwood followed. If what Samil is saying is true, the massive A'Dendri buried beneath the earth here must be the cause of it all. The names Soonari and Kharnus resurface in your mind. Were they mother and father to the A'Dendri people? If so, then this must be Kharnus, the progenitor of the A'Dendri race and apparently, the source of the Deepwood as well. Everything leads back to him. Would killing this giant creature spell the end of the Deepwood?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_3__a">"\"You know who I am not,\" Samil replies with a knowing smile. \"I am clearly not your dead friend, but that much is obvious now.\" 

He regards you for a moment, fixing you with haunting eyes. \"I am many things,\" he continues. \"I am the one who saved you in the forbidden city. I am the one who saved you in the woods. I have been your guide, prodding and nudging you along, bringing you here. You may call me a benefactor of sorts. A purveyor of truths and holder of keys, yet somehow I do not possess the one for my own chains.\" 

Samil places a hand on the great amber boulder swelling within the giant A'Dendri and moves his face close to its surface. Something inside stares back at him. Suddenly, Samil's smile evaporates and his eyes become black pits of hate. \"For eons I have waited here in the depths, remembered only by the land. Barely an echo of my former self. Left to rot in this prison. Crippled. Bound. Broken.\" 

\"But no more,\" he says, his smile returning. \"Our friend here helped me find a way out. The most powerful lies are those laced with truth, and he desperately needed this one to be true.\" An expression of great pleasure creeps across Samil's face. \"He drank from the Life Stream. The Witch Light, as you call it, and the world died. An infinite stream of tortured souls flowed in, driving him utterly mad. Since then, every death has fed me. Everything consumed or claimed, every broken sob, every nightmare, every drop of pain has found its way back here, allowing me to grow within him and the Deepwood to spread. A temple to the power of lies.\" 

Returning his focus to you, Samil stares with amused satisfaction. \"And now it's your turn. For most importantly to you, I am your salvation.\""</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_4__a">"While Samil is busy talking, you assess the giant slumbering A'Dendri to gain insight into what kind of combat threat he represents. He may be immobile now, but his massive arms could nearly reach any point in the cavern, and its body is well-protected by thick bark plates which look like they can turn aside any weapon blow. Looking closely, however, you find small gaps in the armor where a well-placed blade could pierce the fibrous flesh beneath. A corpuscular stench of rot exudes from the creature and unlike the other A'Dendri you have seen, Kharnus is covered in undulating pustules and fungus. Should you face the giant, you would surely be facing his bioweapons as well as his immense strength.

Suddenly, in the shadows behind Kharnus, you see tiny pinpricks of light flicker with each pulse of the amber glow. You do not recall seeing them when you first entered the cavern, but standing there in the darkness are dozens of Deepwood creatures, silently awaiting command. The situation makes you uneasy as they unblinkingly stare back at you. Could Samil be controlling them?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_5__a">"While Samil is busy talking, you try to assess the giant slumbering A'Dendri and gain insight into what kind of combat threat he represents, however, something in the shadows behind Kharnus distracts you.

The situation makes you uneasy as they unblinkingly stare back at you. Could Samil be controlling them?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_6__a">"Your mind races as you try to make sense of it all. The A'Dendri had been right all along. The key to ending the plague, and even the Deepwood itself, lies here. But why did they not try to end it themselves?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_7__a">"Thinking back to your time in the Wychwood, you remember the power of the spores the A'Dendri used to enslave others. If this creature is truly Kharnus, the father of their race, perhaps the madness within the cavern would have overtaken them as well. Instead, they deceived you into coming here to slay the monster they were responsible for creating. 

But their world was dying. The boundaries of their forests were being pushed ever backward by the Deepwood and they were desperate to survive. Desperate people do desperate things. Might you have done the same?"</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_8__a">"You struggle to find logic in the choices made by the A'Dendri. The only thing you are sure of is they deceived you into coming here to deal with a monster they created. Perhaps you would have done the same? The boundaries of their forests were being pushed ever backward by the Deepwood and they were desperate to survive. Desperate people do desperate things."</string>
    <string name="chp21_2_9__a">"And what of this being who pretends to be Samil? You can understand why the A'Dendri would want you here but what about him? If his lies truly led Kharnus to drink from this so-called 'Life Stream', thereby giving birth to the Deepwood, then why would he summon you here to destroy his creation? There is something you are not being told. 

You level the question at the entity wearing Samil's visage. He offers you a serious glare, choosing his next words carefully. \"You are here to make a choice. A choice that must be real. There is power in lies, but far more in truths,\" he replies disdainfully. \"So, you must be told the truth, to decide freely. Only then will it have the power needed.\" 

When you ask him to explain what choice he refers to, Samil slowly turns and peers at the thing writhing inside the great amber stone buried in Kharnus' chest. \"The only choice that has ever mattered, of course. The choice to set me free.\"

A deep groan suddenly emerges from the slumbering giant, shaking the earth. He is slowly waking! At the very same moment, you hear the scrabbling sound of the great horde returning from their feast at Raven's Reach. They will be upon you soon. You have only a few precious minutes to learn as much as possible from the being disguised as Samil."</string>
    <string name="chp21_epi_2__a">"Kharnus roars with rage as your Free Company attacks him with everything you have. Working together, your form is flawless. Waves of creatures crash upon you, only to be turned aside by deadly swings from your weapons. When one of you is threatened, another dives in to protect them, saving lives and ending others. The cavern is a charnel house of corpses, rotted vegetation and chaos. Waves of energy, the color of the Witch Light, pour from the many wounds across Kharnus' body. And inside the great amber stone, Samil's face warps and contorts as the orange crystal begins to fracture. Gnashing teeth, razor-sharp claws and murderous eyes bear down on you in the hundreds. It is a never ending tide of death. Diving beneath Kharnus' sweeping fist, you come up beside the Mad Dreamer's torso. This is your chance. With one last mighty swing, you slam your weapon into the amber stone and it explodes…"</string>
    <string name="chp21_epi_3__a">"Kharnus roars with rage as your Free Company attacks him with everything you have. The giant A'Dendri slams his fists again and again into the floor, the walls and the ceiling. Working together, your form is flawless. Waves of creatures crash upon you, only to be turned aside by deadly swings from your weapons. When one of you is threatened, another dives in to protect them, saving lives and ending others. The cavern is a charnel house of corpses, rotted vegetation and chaos. Waves of energy, the color of the Witch Light, pour from the many wounds across Kharnus' body, yet his immense frame holds strong. Gnashing teeth, razor-sharp claws and murderous eyes bear down on you in the hundreds. It is a never ending tide of death. You need to end this.

Diving beneath Kharnus' sweeping fist, you come up beside one of the writhing tree-like pillars holding the ceiling aloft. This is your chance. You throw your weapon at the Mad Dreamer and scream a challenging roar. Kharnus rounds on you, sending a great, sweeping backhand racing through the air. You dive aside at the last moment, his fist barely passing over you, smashing into the great pillar. The tightly twisted vegetation buckles and breaks beneath the incredible force, fracturing the pillar in two."</string>
    <string name="chp21_epi_4__a">"Your eyes open to blackness. You are flat on the floor, consciousness threatening to slip from you. Several bones have been broken, you can feel each of them now. The pulsing amber light that once lit the cavern has stopped, the heart of the Deepwood finally stilled. You do not hear your companions. In fact, you hear nothing at all. As though the world were holding its breath. Why are the creatures not attacking?

Your answer comes in the form of blue fire as it ignites the corpse of Kharnus. The flames fill the cavern with azure light and you see the hundreds of eyes of the host fixated on the light source, cautiously staring at it like one predator sensing another. Suddenly, there is a chorus of screeching as every creature scrabbles for the many holes scattered across the cave walls, trampling each other in their haste to escape. The towering form of Kharnus, lord of the Wychwood, progenitor of the A'Dendri race, bursts into twisting blue flames, before splitting in two. Stepping from the ruination comes the entity that once called itself Samil. 

The being before you is impossible to comprehend. There are no words to describe it. Every shred of reason you have falters before the sight. The only thing clear in your mind, is your survival instinct screaming for you to run. Suddenly, you remember the Avi prophecy. You were told there would be a choice between darkness and death. Looking at what stands before you, you realise you chose death.

Bone grinding on bone, you force yourself to stand in one last act of defiance. You will fulfil your Oath on your feet. Looking to your side, you see your fellow Oathsworn have joined you. This is how it should end. As one, you raise your weapons and go to join the line of the glorious dead…"</string>
    <string name="chp21_epi_5__a">"\"And what's that tooth from?\" the new patron asks, pointing to an arm-length incisor mounted on the wall.

Greycane smiles, leaning back in his chair in the common room of the new Broken Oak. \"The first trophy they won after we met. Back in Bastone. They saved a lot of lives that day. And many more afterward.\" 

\"They were the ones, right?\" he asks, leaning in. \"The Free Company that ended the plague and stopped the Deepwood growing?\" Greycane nods with a smile. \"What were they like?\" he continues, holding out a fleck of iron as is customary for receiving a tale from a fableman. 

\"Well,\" Greycane says, pushing the man's hand away and refusing the coin. \"Let me tell you a tale…\""</string>
    <string name="chp21_epi_6__a">"You land heavily a dozen feet away. While you are desperately trying to suck air back into your lungs, a twisted beast of fur and fangs pounces on top of you. Without a weapon, you resort to slamming the beast in the face with your bare fists. Teeth fly, but the thing is undeterred. As it unhinges its jaw to engulf your head, a weapon pierces the creature's skull, the blade jutting from its mouth. The corpse slides off your chest and your companion's hand replaces it. Gripping tight, you are helped to your feet. How many times have you saved each other on this journey? Using one of your last precious moments, you meet their gaze and nod to them in thanks one last time.

Looking up, you see the pillars begin to fall as the ceiling bulges. Snaking vines and roots begin to snap, and the world rumbles as the sky falls. Kharnus rages against his bonds as a deafening scream bursts from the amber stone in his chest. Samil has lost, his plan thwarted. He will be sealed in here along with you. The Deepwood will live on and the plague will take its toll. The world will call you failures, but if they had only seen what you saw in Samil's mind, they would think otherwise.

As tons of rock and earth crash down, you think back to the Avi prophecy. They warned a choice would lead to either darkness or death. You know now - you chose darkness. Before you draw your last breath, you find peace in knowing you made the right choice."</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_1__a">"Location 10 – The Palace

The palace has seen better days, its luster worn away by the many thousands of lives that have trodden its halls. Bastone, like every settlement to have survived, is bursting at the seams with humanity. The presence of the Deepwood forever ensuring space and materials are more precious than people. Even here the press of bodies can be felt as petitioners line the outer corridors while, inside, hundreds of menials and servants scurry about their tasks.

You are led under guard to the high hall and told to wait before an ornate double door.

A master servant appears through the door and looks you up and down suspiciously."</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_2__a">"\"Oh, Vile!\" the servant spits. \"Warden? That… thing, cannot enter my Lord's presence,\" pointing to the witch. \"No disrespect to one of the Inquisition, but I humbly request you stay with it to protect us all.\" The servant spits again toward himself, then ushers the rest of the Free Company into the antichamber, leaving you with a number of the Lord's personal retinue. They eye your witch with visible hatred and one spits in her face as she stares vehemently back.

\"My lord warden,\" one of them pipes up. \"We don't know how you teach your pets in Verum, but we make sure they learn not to look us in the eye like that here.\" He takes a step forward and grips an iron cudgel, \"May we show your pet some manners?\"


The Warden must choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_3__c">The witch falls to her knees with the blow. Then you raise your hand as he goes to strike again. You need her functional. The guard stops, spits at the witch once more, then returns to his post and the malicious grin of his squadmate.</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_4__a">"The man sprawls, your mailed hand splitting his lip and spraying blood across the floor.

The man turns in shock, never thinking you would protect a witch. With disgust he slowly rises and returns to his post without a word, nursing his jaw."</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_5__a">"The Witch:

You feel your senses pop as the collar deactivates. Perhaps turning this man's saliva to ice might just keep him from spitting at people in future. With a gesture of your hand you fill his mouth with frozen saliva. You hear what you hope is at least one tooth exploding and he reels clutching his jaw. Terror spreads across his face. He thought he had been safe with the warden near. With muffled cries of pain, he runs. The other guards turn to stones of terror. You feel the collar consume you again."</string>
    <string name="chp2_10_6__a">"In the antechamber, the servant ushers you forward. \"Welcome, honored guests. You are most timely. My Lord awaits within. I would ask you to leave your weapons here, but I know your Oath. We honor the pact, but if you must carry them please refrain from any sudden movements. There will be crossbows trained on you at all times. This way please.\"

The master servant claps his hands and double doors open, allowing you to pass. Within is a grand hall of arched stone and skylights. No amber torches are needed to light this place.

\"My Lord Davenish. May I present the Free Company from Verum.\"

Davenish is a portly man with a tight-cropped black beard and piercing eyes. He rises from behind a long meeting table bedecked in bowls and dishes of fine food.

\"The Ratcatchers. Good. I trust you're rested?\" Without waiting for a reply he continues, \"Your service to my town is noted, but I must ask something else of you.\"

He looks disgustedly at a bowl of fruit set to the side of the table and slams his fist next to it. He plucks a now crushed insect up.

\"Cockroaches. They're everywhere. This town has an infestation. Not this kind of bug though. Something more insidious and harder to kill. Have you heard of The Piper?\"

You shake your heads.

\"A cult leader, a traitor,\" Davenish continues. \"He preys on the weak-minded and draws them to him with promises of streets full of food and iron if they will but join him in overthrowing the natural order of things. His gang of thugs has been attacking my patrols and sacked several shops. He must be stopped. Without the natural order, where lords shepherd the people, the peasantry would collapse into anarchy. They cannot rule themselves, let alone others. The ignorant fool, he would doom us all. There will be blood in the streets, and it won't be on my hands.\"

\"No town or city can survive a civil war with the Deepwood at the gates. So I ask you, will you break from hunting witches and boogeymen to run this man to ground? I know this is not your contract here, but I will see you handsomely rewarded for your efforts. This town has stood for over five hundred years and never once has the line of lords broken faith with the pact. Now the town needs you. Will YOU break faith with it?\""</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_10__a">"The street urchin you remember from your arrival in Bastone puts his hand down on your table.

\"A message for you from High Lord Davenish. This is official business here. He wants you at the palace. I ran here fast as the streets would take me and I've done my best to give you a good name and not disappoint his High Lord. Yet another show of my usefulness and good faith and all. Due to that, I am willing to let you reconsider having me as a faithful and well paid guide.\"

He smiles, \"I'll throw in today's message as a free delivery to show my character and, from here on in, the rest is negotiable.\""</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_1__a">Location 13 – The Broken Oak</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_1__c">"Thistle vines tear at your arms as you dash by tortured tree trunks and splash through the soggy underbrush, desperate to distance yourselves from the encroaching beast. You know it is there, but dare not turn to look. Don't trip. Your heart clenches as you feel the hot animal breath at your back. Your weapon, where is it? The thing is gaining. The thudding footfalls pound in your ears. A rising shadow looms over you. Then… nothing. No more branches being torn behind. No more splashing. You slow, then walk and eventually stop, breathless and terrified.

You look to one another. Samil comes up, the last of you as always. He wipes his brow and shakes his head.

\"It's gone,\" he says adjusting his leather strap breastplate with one hand and grabbing the Wire Road with the other. You return his faint smile and face back to the path. Suddenly, there is a loud, plucked thrum on the wire behind you. You turn as Samil is pulled screaming into the Deepwood. Something huge surges from the trees, orange eyes flashing."</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_2__c">You dive into the cover of the woods, flailing your arms to clear the path of vines and blankets as you suddenly find yourselves lying in the straw mattress bed of the Broken Oak.</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_2__e">"You look quickly around. Each of you, now startled awake, sits in blankets and pillows damp with sweat. One look at each other confirms you all saw the same thing.

No debate is necessary as you gather your gear and head downstairs to clear your heads. Seeing Samil die again has shaken everyone, though it hadn't been like that the first time. Your old brother-in-arms had died on the road to Bastone and no one had seen what happened to him then. One thing is certain, however. That was more than just an ordinary nightmare."</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_3__c">You dive into the cover of the woods, flailing your arms to clear the path of vines and blankets as you suddenly find yourself lying in the straw mattress bed of The Broken Oak.</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_3__e">"You look quickly around. Each of you now startled awake, sits in blankets and pillows damp with sweat. Some of your sheets are streaked in blood where you have clawed at your own skin. One look at each other confirms you all saw the same thing.

No debate is necessary as you gather your gear and head downstairs to clear your heads. Seeing Samil die again has shaken everyone, though it hadn't been like that the first time; no one had seen what happened to him then. One thing is sure, that was more than just an ordinary nightmare."</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_4__a">"As you finish a shared plate of cheese and roots carefully prepared by Innkeeper Bram, Greycane, the fableman and proprietor of The Broken Oak, works his way across the crowded room and seats himself at your table sporting a jovial look.

\"I've seen corpses look better than you lot. Hells, even my ex-wife could summon a better face on a bad day and she was Cistercian.\"

You wonder at how a man from a town like Bastone would ever have come to marry one of the famously religious, famously celibate people.

Greycane breaks your reverie with a question. Leaning in, his countenance changes, eyes dark and voice low, \"Having bad dreams are we?\""</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_5__a">"Your silence answers him. He nods in acceptance and goes to leave you in peace, doing so with a suggestion.

\"Take it from an old traveler. I've also seen things no one wants to see. Now, I'm not one to pry, but I'd say this. Go see Lyceen. The apothecary. Let her help. Also… listen to your dreams. They're there to teach you something.\""</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_6__a">"Greycane nods as you detail your reliving of Samil's death. He exhales a long, slow breath.

\"I'd be a liar if I told you I never had bad dreams. Things I've seen. But, I've never had a dream that took a bite out of me. Yours is not the only strange tale I've heard in Bastone lately. People dreaming wrong. Orange eyes staring back at them. Go see Lyceen. The apothecary. Let her help. Also… listen to your dreams. They're there to teach you something.\""</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_8__a">"The Banksmith, Gamel, enters the tavern, clearly agitated. He heads to Greycane and urgently puts a three-fingered hand on his shoulder.

Greycane turns to the man, concern on his face, \"What is it, old friend?\"

\"Tam. Have you seen him? He's not come home,\" Gamel replies.

\"You know what youth are like. I think you might even have been one once. With a face like that you must have gotten yourself lost more than once,\" he says encouragingly to the thick-armed Banksmith. Bram lets out a short laugh clearly deciding Gamel has a face only a mother could love.

Gamel eyes Bram briefly before continuing, \"Please. He's all I have.\"

\"Of course,\" replies Greycane. \"I'll put out word for him with my contacts.\"

Gamel nods gratefully and leaves the tavern. Greycane shakes his head, \"Hmm. He's not the first to be looking for someone. Tam is a good one. Perhaps he has intentionally gotten himself lost, but my gut tells me otherwise…\"

As the silence lingers, your eye is drawn to the window of the Tavern. Staring back at you through the glass, unmoving, is Samil, your fallen comrade - face gaunt, eyes accusing. You blink and he is gone. As you rise from your seat, you are interrupted."</string>
    <string name="chp2_13_9__a">"Having appeared from nowhere, young Midge and his uncontrolled mop of hair slides easily next to Greycane. \"I've a message for you from High Lord Davenish himself. Got up extra early too to be sure I was the one that got to give it to you. I'd rather be waking than the dreams I was having last night. He wants you at the palace. I have a chance to prove myself to a new and rich client so do me right and show him that I got to you straight away. Oh, and that'll be 1 iron for the runner,\" he says innocently holding out his palm."</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_1__a">"THE DEEPWOOD

You run to the wall and, as you look over, your blood runs cold. It is not the body impaled on the spikes that shakes you, but the hand reaching from the Deepwood toward it. You cannot see the creature for the trees, but the arm is immense. Roped muscles bunch under bristling fur. Claws wrap around the body and pluck it from the stake like fruit from a vine. Then, slowly, the arm is drawn back under the canopy leaving a trail of blood in its wake.

Stepping back from the edge you rush to find ropes. There is no time to wait till morning. Earth and root would drink the blood long before. That thing is responsible for what is happening in this town. You know what you must do, this is often how these things begin. You prepare to follow the blood."</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_2__a">"You hurry down the rope and prepare to dive into the Deepwood. Guards watch nervously from the top of the wall.

Following the blood trail dragged through the underbrush is no problem for those trained in the ways of the wild. Heading deeper in, the shadows consume you and the sounds of the town quickly die away to be replaced by an oppressive silence."</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_3__a">"There is a strange gentle sobbing as you approach an open space between the trees. Weapons drawn, you crouch and shelter behind trunks as you work your way toward it.

Hanging from a branch lashed by vines that dig deep into his arms is a young boy, struggling to catch each gulping breath. The vines above him are twisted like a rope, run-through with broken weapons, pots, bones and sticks. They clatter slightly in the swaying breeze. Any motion would cause a tremendous racket. His belt has been torn and lies several feet below him in the leaves, a large black hammer still tucked into it, never drawn to fight off whatever did this to him.

Tam. The Banksmith's son. His half-open eyes showing the unnatural orange you saw before. He scans the woods with a hypnotic gaze as if looking for something.

The large bulk you have been following lumbers in the treeline past this clearing.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_4__c">"Making sure there is no danger, you step out into the open space motioning to Tam to stay quiet. The boy locks onto you and immediately begins to scream and thrash about, creating a cacophony from the objects in the vines above.

You go immediately on the defensive. The boy is killing himself. The barbed vines around Tam cut deeply into his neck as he thrashes, draining the life from him. You have no time to help the boy though, as something approaches.

You feel it before you see it. A primal fear washes over you. You see two cloven hooves, then gaze slowly upward into the trees to be met by two giant orange eyes staring back."</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_5__c">There are several options open to you, but which route is best to take?</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_6__c">"A swift thrown blade pierces the boy and his vigil stops. It was the only way to be sure he wouldn't raise the alarm. You walk past the body and find a locket on the ground beneath Tam's feet."</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_6__e">On the other side of the space you find Tam has not been alone in his confinement. A macabre display of human marionettes hang contorted from numerous branches in the trees beyond. There, in the middle of them is the beast, hunched over the broken form it carried from the wall, delicately lashing the body to a broken tree limb. Now is the time to strike. Charging from the trees you bellow a challenge and its ugly horned head rises. Giant orange eyes meet yours.</string>
    <string name="chp2_60_7__a">You sneak past Tam, his eyes certainly a sentry for this creature. On the other side of the space you find Tam has not been alone in his confinement.

    <string name="chp2_epi_1__a">"THE DEEPWOOD

The Satyr shudders, ichor seeping from a dozen cuts. It seems to be smiling even now as if it relishes the pain. Advancing on the fiend to finish it off the Satyr raises its mighty arms and darklight wreathes the clearing. Your vision twists and blurs and when it returns the Satyr is gone. No tracks, just gone. You hope it has gone somewhere to die, but you doubt it. Wherever it went, it will think twice before preying on Bastone again.

You go to see if any of the people in the trees are still alive, but find them long dead, their bodies broken and twisted. You hope they died quickly. A search of the surrounding area gleans several items."</string>
    <string name="chp2_epi_1__c">"Losing the light fast, you hurry back to Bastone. There you find Gamel the Banksmith watching from the walls awaiting your return.

'My boy, did you find him?'"</string>
    <string name="chp2_epi_3__a">"You tell Gamel how the Satyr killed his son. An uncommon anger rises in Gamel and brokenness pours out of him. 'I knew he was gone. I felt it in my gut. I knew. Why didn't I go after him? That thing's still alive somewhere. I vow by my good arm I'll kill that creature. I WILL have vengeance, Free Company. I don't care how long it takes or how much blood is spilt. I'm coming with you.'"</string>
    <string name="chp2_epi_3__c">The light gone from the day, you make your way by amber torch back to The Broken Oak for what you hope is a dreamless sleep.</string>
    <string name="chp2_epi_4__a">"You show Gamel the locket and tell him what had to be done to make safe the Free Company.

Gamel raises his eyes to you. He draws his hammer from the loop at his waist and attacks you with the ferocity born of grief.

Gamel fights like a man possessed."</string>
    <string name="chp2_epi_4__c">"It takes your combined might to bring Gamel down, but a blow to the head silences the father's rage. You had no choice. He would not stop his onslaught, so desperate was his need for vengeance. Gamel's body lays at your feet, one more casualty in the war on the Deepwood."</string>

Well, I call it treason. I'm sure they are operating close to their hideout. I am no hunter, but I am sure if you follow the circles you'll find your man.\""</string>
    <string name="chp2a_12_1__a">"Location 12 – The Market

There is an air of disquiet in today's commerce as an eerie hushed tone blankets the town market. Old women shake their heads and gossip in small clusters as they pause in their trading. Citizens glance nervously up alleyways while they go about their daily chores and people seem to be constantly looking over their shoulders. The mood is tense, but life in Bastone pushes on."</string>

\"Are they lords of men?\" an angry man shouts, standing on an old trunk to one side of the town square. \"We toil and they take our children as slaves. They withhold our wages and sit in luxury while we starve. We…\" A cosh smashes the man's face. He falls from his pedestal and city guards drag him away.

The rumbling of the crowd grows. As you look back to the man's trunk, you find Samil now standing on top of it, arms reaching out above the crowd. You then hear the familiar thrum of a wire and he is yanked away. The scene begins to settle as the crowd disperses. You make your way to the spot where Samil was standing. Painted on the flagstones are orange circles."</string>

As you travel up the oddly angled alleyways, you hear a deep, male voice bellow from around a corner. \"Come on then! Who wants to die first?\"

You pick up speed, drawing your weapons. Turning a blind corner, you find a thick-armed, brute of a man standing between a gang of men and a woman with two small children. The children cower against a wet wall, underneath clearly painted orange circles. Ten men with torn shirts wielding animal bones and wooden spikes close in on them.

The stockades are empty and a lone guard leans against one, eyeing all passersby with suspicion as he grips his spear. Upon seeing you he stands a little straighter.

\"My lords, how may I serve?\" You mention you are no one's lord and proceed to ask him about the gang and the circles. \"Damned if I know, my lord,\" he replies, oblivious to your correction. \"Hell, I don't know what to think anymore. I can't even protect them from themselves. Not ten days back, they bring in these two thieves. I know them. It ain't all that big a town, you know? And they put them in stock and chain for the weekend. I go grab a bowl of grub come noon, and when I get back – dead. Both. They bit their own tongues out.

Satisfied that the records support everything you're being told, you head back out.

Situated on top of a tenement building surrounded by a garden of herbs, you arrive at the small hut of the town's lone apothecary, Lyceen. The colorful plants are a stark contrast to the slate black roofs and brown timbers of the rest of the town. It strikes you that there is no crowd outside the establishment. Apothecaries normally have a hive of people jostling about, waiting to have their ills tended to. Here there are none.

As you come closer you see why. Hastily scrawled in jagged letters, the word 'witch' stretches across the entire side of the hut. Lyceen tries in vain to scrub away the carved letters with a rough stone. She pauses as she takes note of your presence, but does not turn to address you.

\"Come to collect a witch?\" she asks, scrubbing harder now. \"That's what the crowds want, isn't it? If you don't, they will. This doesn't end well for me regardless.\"

You stay alert with this woman, but you know better than most that only a handful of witch hunts actually involve a witch.

The moon begins to rise and you have still not found your quarry, you know the eyes have been seen in a number of locations creating a ring in which these thugs have been operating. Perhaps they store their weapons and supplies in a cache closeby? Resolving to take one last stab at it before returning to The Broken Oak, you head for the center of the ring."</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_1__a">"The Piper's Lair"</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_1__c">"You find yourself in a quiet street, the clues of the orange circles leading you to this singular spot. At first glance this is a street like any other until you notice the well. Looking over the lip there seems to be no water at the bottom. The inner walls of the shaft are lined with uneven splotches of orange paint, a thousand eyes staring at each other.

A set of handholds have been carved into the well walls, forming a stone ladder down into the dark below.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_2__a">"You drop the lit torch into the hole and it sparks off a stone floor some 20 feet below. There is a room down there. You hear a voice below and a rapid shuffling sound. This is the place. Hurriedly, you climb into the well and descend the shaft.

At the bottom you find a dark room lit only by your torch light. The light reflects off a thousand orange eyes scrawled on the floor, walls and ceiling. All eyes focusing on a single chair and table in the room's center. Maps and inks can be made out and a solitary candle curls smoke into the stagnant air.

In the corner of the room is a figure, obviously The Piper, who claws at a hole in one corner. Fingers bleeding, an inhumanly deep tone rolls from his throat. \"He is mine to kill, you shall not have him.\" The eyes glint orange for a moment then the figure writhes through the small hole into an adjoining chamber."</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_3__a">The handholds are slick and ill fitting. You descend as quietly as you can.</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_4__a">"You fall for what feels like an eternity. Then cold stone slams into your back and you gasp for air.

You have fallen a dozen feet and pain shoots through you."</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_4__c">"You hear scrabbling and see a figure rise from a solitary chair and snuff out the room's only candle, plunging it into darkness leaving only two orange eyes. The eyes stare at you for a moment as if weighing your doom, then they disappear as the figure turns away.

The others join you and you strike a flint to your torch. The light does not travel far, as if consumed by the shadows. What you can see unsettles you. Thousands of orange eyes are scrawled on the walls, floors and ceiling; all focused on that single chair and table in the room's center. Maps and inks can be made out and a solitary candle curls smoke into the stagnant air.

In the corner of the room the figure, obviously The Piper, claws at a hole in one corner.

    <string name="chp2a_50_5__a">"Some 20 feet down you start to see a faint glow reflecting from the stone beneath you. With nothing left to do but descend you drop the remaining distance into a small room.

The two guards at the bottom of the well shaft never see you coming, two blades flash and two bodies hit the floor.

A figure looks up at you from behind a table in surprise. Quickly, he rises and snuffs out the room's only candle, plunging it into darkness leaving only two orange eyes. The eyes stare at you for a moment then they disappear as the figure turns away.

On the other side, the smell of wet earth greets you and you see roots and mushrooms growing in patches along the walls. You must be in an Underways tunnel. From further down the passage you can hear running footsteps through puddles. You set off at a run, trying to gain ground.

You wind your way through the tunnels, your mark always just beyond sight. He knows these paths and you are encumbered. You fear you might lose him. Then, turning a corner you see feet disappearing upwards. A ladder reaches to a hatch in the ceiling. Taking two rungs at a time you burst through the hatch, coming out at the foot of the outer wall of Bastone.

You can make out The Piper standing atop the wall, he has stopped as if waiting for you. Cautiously you ascend the stone stairway to find Samil standing next to the man. Samil leans in, whispers in his ear, and gestures out to the Deepwood as if offering the man a seat. The Piper nods with a smile and steps to the edge."</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_8__a">The Piper steps from the wall, never looking down. Moments later you hear a gurgled thud as his body hits the floor below.</string>
    <string name="chp2a_50_9__a">The Piper leans over the parapet and you grab his arm. He realizes he is no longer falling and becomes angry. Wheeling on you, he bites down on your hand hard. You instinctively let go and he plummets from the wall.</string>
    <string name="chp2a_5_1__a">"Location 5 – The Barracks

The Barracks are solemn. The guards are obviously tense as they await their next patrol. Samil sits at a table with a squad, his unmoving eyes fixed on you. Then, there is a sound of a thrum on the wire and he is yanked backwards into nothingness."</string>
    <string name="chp2a_6_1a__a">"Location 6 – The Church

Mourners line the steps of the church. A lone guard maintains order amongst the crowd, but you take note of his obviously nervous demeanor. You approach the guard and ask him why everyone has gathered.

\"Reverend Kuthnell. They… sacrificed him on his own altar. I found him myself. Nothing's safe no more.\"

You proceed to scan the immediate area, looking for the orange circles that Lord Davenish mentioned. Your eyes lock onto a familiar face - Samil. His haunting eyes stare at you in silent disappointment.

You press toward him, pushing your way between the mourners, when suddenly you hear the loud thrum of the Wire Road. In a blink, Samil is gone. As you reach the spot where he was standing, you find circles daubed on the stone walkway."</string>

Celeste, the Overseer, is quick to respond when you ask to speak with her. She arrives from the tunnels, caked in dirt and brushing a worm from her tunic.

\"Things are bad. My people are afraid to travel. Some don't show up for their shift. I try to keep them in crews of three or more, even topside. Production has slowed to a crawl because I've had to post some of my strongest men as guards. We haven't been attacked down here. Yet. But I can't be too careful. They'd have to be out of their minds to attack us and jeopardize their food, but I heard they attacked one of the Brothers at the church so maybe there's nothing these animals won't do. As for your circles. I've heard of them and I may have seen them topside, but the moment I find any of that paint down here, you'll be able to hear my anger from the Deepwood.\""</string>

Some sort of shared vision is infecting your sleep. You've heard enough whispers around town to know you are not the only ones experiencing these nightmares.

You thought it had been the rat killings putting the glint of fear in passersby, but there is still something haunting the people. You set about to finding as much as you can about the dreams of the townsfolk. There is a slow pulsing feeling around this fear, a pendulum swinging closer and closer. A creeping doom that incessantly pricks at the corners of your mind. Something is going to happen. Soon.

Across the street, the dead eyes of Samil survey you as he smiles. There is the sound of a thrum of the Wire Road and he is gone."</string>

You approach a guard that's about to change shifts and climb to his place on the tower.

\"Yeah, I have dreams,\" the guard nods when you ask him if he's heard of the nightmares. \"Like an orange sunset with two suns. Only, they ain't the good kind. They hurt the eyes. Make you sick. A bad SUNSET. Something's just wrong with it, makes my skin itch thinking about it.\""</string>

The Market square has a strange, hushed tone and people look over their shoulders. It is evident that people have been having bad dreams here. There is a palpable pressure in the air, building to something. Angry men working long days pull carts through the street. Old women shake their heads and gossip in small clusters as they pause in their trading. The mood is tense, but whatever the pressure is, you see nothing, yet."</string>
    <string name="chp2b_14_1__a">"Location 14 – The Town Square

People avoid your gaze and are loath to speak to you. Those who do, whisper about a 'witch' under their breath, and spit before them in protection. You hear no mention of dreams, though some do mention the odd nature of the guards as of late.

Looking to the center of the square you see the ominous iron burning posts driven deep into the flagstones. Samil is there leaning against one, that wry grin he used to have spread wide across his face. You blink and he is gone.

\"My lords, how may I serve?\" You mention you're no one's lord and ask about the strange dreams. \"Damned if I know, my lord,\" he replies, oblivious to your correction. \"Hell, there's some strange things happening though. Not ten days back, they bring in these two thieves. I know them. It ain't all that big a town, you know? And they put them in stock and chain for the weekend. I go grab a bowl of potato come noon, when I get back – dead. Both. They bit their own tongues out. Spat them right there and tried slicing their own wrists on their restraints. What witchery does that?\"

\"Oh. Come to think of it, my lord, there was some lad from one of the other squads mentioning dreams. Think they're watching on the wall today.\""</string>

    <string name="chp2b_24_1__a">"Location 24 – The Burrows

Mud and slop fill the streets as you wade through the rain of the Burrows. Here, a warren of tightly packed terraces cross and recross each other as they have been added to again and again over the years in an attempt to create more space. As you walk under one of the overhead walkways something splashes on the back of your hand. Not rain, blood. You look up and see a dark room connecting to the walkway. Climbing a nearby staircase you find the door to the room ajar, a line of blood running from its entrance.

Upon entry you see two forms lying prone on the floor, thick shadows draped over them. A male and a female of middling age. They are covered in scratch marks and bruises. Household objects lie around the couple, broken and obviously used upon each other. These people killed one another. What could have possessed them to…

A movement in the corner of the room catches your eye. Your hands go to your weapon. A pair of eyes peer out from the shadow and a boy's face appears. He is no more than his twelfth year, his clothes dirty and his feet bare. He just stares at his parents.

You try to talk to him to find out what happened, but he remains silent. He seems broken somehow, unable to speak of the horror he witnessed. It seems Bastone will have another street urchin before long when people find the room unclaimed.

\"I am no washerwoman. I do not record dreams,\" Millus says with disdain. \"However, there is an issue I would share with you now your hunt is completed. Suicides have gone up in recent months. An anomaly, but not unheard of. Fifty-two years ago there was a similar spike,\" Archivist Millus explains, unraveling a scroll on a creaking wooden table before you. \"Many took their own lives. Young, old, men and women. No discernible pattern. Ha! Melfis, the archivist at the time, ascribes it to witches and bogots… poor excuse for a historian. If I were a betting man, which I most certainly am not, I would seek out those alchemists, some compound perhaps causing an imbalance in the humors. The apothecary Lyceen may know more.\"

On top of a tenement building you find the apothecary. Her small hut is surrounded by a garden of herbs, the greens a stark contrast to the slate black roofs and brown timbers of the rest of the town. It strikes you that there is no crowd outside. Every apothecary you have ever seen has been accompanied by a hive of people jostling to have their ills tended to. Here, there was no one.

As you come closer you see why. Hastily scrawled letters proclaim 'witch' on the side of the hut and its lone window is broken.

Lyceen sits slumped on a stool, herbs, powders and several rocks scattered about the floor. She holds a bloody rag to her head.

\"Come to collect a witch?\" she asks, looking up painfully. \"That's what the crowds want, isn't it? If you don't, they will. I've a growing collection of rocks to tell me that.\"

When you press him, he has no recollection of a face, a place, or anything. But each of the guards has been seeing a WOMAN IN BLACK, and each of the guards is terrified by her, fearing she will do something to them.

The peace you felt at waking turns to unease as you take in the mood of the hall. Patrons mutter angrily and seem to be stirring up their blood for something to come. Men and women are streaming from the inn to join a procession of others in the street, all heading in the same direction.

It stops at an intersection and snorts, pawing the street with a front claw and easily tearing up the stone like a bull on a dirt path. An oily smoke oozes from the creature's neck that wreathes it in a dark cloud, the smoke seething like ink in water. Those unfortunate enough to be near it seize and collapse in violent convulsions.

Behind you, Lord Davenish bellows from his raised box surrounded by a company of his house guard. \"To arms men! For your Lord and Bastone! Slay the beast!\" Several men begin to charge, but many more falter at the sight of the thing.

Something alights in its tremendous eyes. Massive rear legs force the storm gray armored hulk forward. In mere breaths, it is in the square. Davenish freezes in disbelief as the sun above him is blotted out and a claw the size of a merchant's cart descends on him. Where he stood is now merely a fine crimson mist. Without pausing, the Terror of Bastone careens onwards."</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_21__c">"The beast is barrelling through the Town Square. It has come from the east, breaking through Bastone's outer wall, and now curves off to its right. You must stay away from it in order to escape. You are positioned so that three paths are open to you."</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_2__c">"Two guards immediately step forward and cross their spears in front of you, blocking your path.

\"You may have done us great service with the rats,\" the official says, stopping his listing of offenses, \"But this witch is Bastone's to burn. Blood for blood, right for right. Your job is done. This is ours.\""</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_4__a">"Their quarry bound in place, the guards point their spears to the crowd to move them back. More than one spear is angled to hold you in place.

Lyceen winces and looks to the crowd angrily, \"Haven't I helped you? I tended your wounds and you pay me with fire?\"

Urging the crowd to silence, the official announces, \"This… creature has lived among us, as one of us, but no longer. Today Bastone protects you all and makes safe her people.\"

Another official comes from a side alley, carrying a sputtering torch. He thrusts it skyward and the town cheers in anticipation.

\"Holds anyone an objection to this justice?\"

The crowd around you roars a bloodthirsty, \"NO!\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_5__c">"\"I object.\"

The crowd grows silent.

\"Thank you, thank you,\" Lyceen mutters between broken sobs.

Lord Davenish, who has been observing the scene from a raised box surrounded by his house guard, leans forward. \"You object?\" he sneers. \"You ARE protectors. This is what you do? Try to free a monster? Let more children vanish in the night?\"

He motions to the official who throws the torch into the oiled wood pile by Lyceen's feet.

\"Objection overruled.\""</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_6__a">"Lyceen looks on in horror as the official lowers the flame to the oil coated woodpile at her feet.

The fire spits as it catches."</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_7__a">"The smoke curls in thick oily tendrils that begin to swirl around Lyceen.

\"No!\" she cries. \"I've hurt no one! I've helped this town! I've healed you!\"

She lurches and tries to move away as flames grow and lick at her calves.

\"You have no idea what you've done! I cannot help you and I cannot stop what is going to happen now! You are all doomed!\"

She screams, but it is a sound like nothing you have ever heard. It strikes the base of your skulls. A piercing whine that makes you flinch. Several in the crowd double over as the shockwave washes through the Town Square. The flames reach up her legs as she continues the obscene wailing noise. The sound pushes into your spine and assaults your mind as the smell of burning flesh fills the square. The keening scream reaches an unholy crescendo. Her throat should be torn by such a noise. You reach to cover your ears, but it doesn't lessen the pain.

The ground shakes.

There is screaming from the distant walls of Bastone.

Greycane looks at you, \"That wasn't her. That sound. Something is coming.\"

There is screaming. Rumbling. The sound of shattering stone.

People on the rooftops stand and turn.

\"The Deepwood comes alive!\" one screams.

\"It's huge!\"

\"What is that!\"

\"RUN!\"

\"The witch brought it!\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp3_14_9__c">"Something tremendous is pushing through the town. Buildings fall like reeds underfoot as a wave of destruction heads toward you. Rising smoke forms a trail toward the square.

She collapses as you cut her free of her bonds and kick at the flames. She is badly blistered. Lyceen smiles, her lips cracking. Guards leap up and seize each of you from behind.

\"You should have done that… earlier…\" she coughs harshly. Taking heaving breaths, \"I could not stop the keening. I fear…\"

She is cut short by a shuddering of the earth.

\"Too late!\" she gasps.

The guards release you as there is a vast cracking sound. Up the street you can see a massive shape snap a building in two. Whatever it is, it's heading for the square."</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_10__a">Gnarled branches begin to sway. Not the wind. Something else. The civilians panic and run in every direction. The vibrations intensify. The earth around you churns as you feel the immensity of it moving beneath your feet. The earth around one of the men bulges upward and serrated tusks burst from the ground. The man screams as he plummets into a great maw and the Wyrm rises. The head extends fifteen feet from the ground. The eyeless mass of pallid flesh turns toward the group, hungering. It cannot see you, but it can sense your presence.</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_1__a">"Beyond the Wall

You press into the Deepwood as Bastone dies. The walls are broken, as are her people. Screams and wails saturate the air, an anthem of death rolling from Bastone. You Turn to see it one last time. Men hurl themselves from the walls, claiming their own lives before the monsters can. Great fissures swallow sections of the wall. The titanic beast continues to pound the city to dust. You press on."</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_1__c">"You put distance between you and the city. Around you, clusters of people dive through the underbrush only to disappear moments later followed by a thing of nightmare.

There is no Wire Road. There is no path. Your weapons sing as you slice through vines and roots. Mud, blood and tears wash over every survivor who's made it this far."</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_4__a">"After a time, the noise of destruction dims to the sound of your heavy breathing and the footfalls of the party. You stop and take in your surroundings.

The party looks ragged and Greycane has his arm around Bram's shoulders as the man weeps into his hands. \"Chin up mate. It's not as bad as your root porridge. If we can survive that, we can survive this.\" Bram lets out a single snotty laugh. Greycane continues, \"Survive, for them. While you live, Bastone lives. Keep on.\"

Greycane leaves the man and walks over. \"People need to know what happened here. We have to reach Verum.\""</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_5__a">"Behind you, you hear a voice calling out from the Deepwood. \"Hey! You weren't going to leave without me, were you?\" Turning, you see the young, disheveled form of Midge running through the trees. Somehow this young lad survived the Doom of Bastone and managed to find you, even here. \"Did I mention I'm also an excellent tracker and Deepwood guide, too?\""</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_5__c">Together you plunge back into the Deepwood.</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_6__a">"Up ahead, you see shadows around a tree. You slow and, as you get closer, you see Greycane nonchalantly leaning against its trunk. Bram is at his feet tapping ale from a barrel on the ground into a clutched mug in his shaking hand. Greycane smiles. \"Not bad for your first doomed town escape, but I'm sure you will do better next time.\"

Bram begins to weep and Greycane puts an arm around his friend. \"Chin up mate. It's not as bad as your root porridge. If we can survive that, we can survive this.\" Bram lets out a single snotty laugh. Greycane continues, \"Survive, for them. While you live, Bastone lives. Keep on.\"

    <string name="chp3_30_8__a">"Thankfully, your life line is still with you. You look down at your compass. You know Verum lies to the southeast, but you could miss it by miles if you don't find the Wire Road.

A sudden noise whips your head up. Not one noise, but many noises. The party gathers around you and you steady your breath, ready to receive an attack.

A large group of people burst from the underbrush, flailing and clutching at bags of supplies and belongings. There are at least a dozen civilians. They are terrified. Catching your eye, a woman rushes toward you. \"Help us. Please. It's coming!\" You are about to ask what when…"</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_9__c">Gnarled branches begin to sway. Not the wind. Something else. You press your ears to the nearest sickly tree. The vibrations, you know what this is.</string>
    <string name="chp3_30_9__e">\"Nobody move!\" you cry. The Free Company immediately comply as do most of the civilians. Not enough, though. One man panics and begins to run for a tree. The vibrations intensify, the earth around you churns as you feel the immensity of it moving beneath your feet. The earth around the runner bulges upward and serrated tusks burst from the ground. The man screams as he plummets into a great maw and the Wyrm rises. The head extends fifteen feet from the ground as the eyeless mass of pallid flesh turns toward the group, hungering. It cannot see you, but it can sense your presence.</string>
    <string name="chp3_epi_1__a">"THE DEEPWOOD

Ichor and viscera are everywhere. The beast took some killing, but the mass before you finally stops writhing. You gather back the people to your side and count the cost."</string>
    <string name="chp3_epi_1__c">"These people have nowhere to go and will not leave your side. Fortunately they had the forethought to bring food and water with them.

Looking over the great corpse before you, you get to work stripping it of anything that will be of value to you in the Deepwood. There are also several items amongst the fallen."</string>
    <string name="chp3_epi_1__e">Coated in ichor and slime, you trudge deeper into the woods. You cannot spare the water to wash yourselves. You must find the Wire Road or all this is for nothing.</string>
    <string name="chp3a_10_1__a">"Location 10 – The Palace

You rush to the Palace. The creature easily widens the street as it lumbers in, thrusting its armored head into the avenue outside the Palace. The throng disperses, but several fall victim to the odd yellowish smoke that surrounds the beast.

A shadow looms over your heads, blocking the sun as it slams into the Palace steps. It swings its head, throwing the unfortunate few who froze in fear. A curled horn catches a guardsman, he hits the ground next to you like a broken marionette. The creature roars a deafening sound and rears its massive bulk."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_10_1__c">The Shadow passes by you as the Doom of Bastone crushes a retinue of guards, giving you just enough time to make your escape.</string>
    <string name="chp3a_12_1__a">"Location 12 – The Market

The Market is filled with looters knocking over carts and stalls, climbing over each other as they grab what food and weapons they can before fleeing to the Main Gate.

You know you will also need rations in the Deepwood. You see an overturned grocery cart with a dozen people swarming it. You also see a Tinker's stall with a man beneath it. It still has a few iron items left on top.

    <string name="chp3a_12_2__a">"You wade into the mass of humanity to retrieve what rations you can.

    <string name="chp3a_12_3__a">There are some items on the table, but they are of little use. What would you do with a horse shoe? Eyes gazing at the body beneath the table, you see it is clutching something… a chest hidden beneath the mass. You roll the body away and find it opens. There are some valuable items inside.</string>
    <string name="chp3a_12_3__c">"You hear screaming. The creature is trampling the Barracks as you run for the Banksmith's."</string>

Greycane appears from a side alley with a bundle of leatherbound papers under his arm. \"A welcome sight,\" Greycane calls as you make your way to The Broken Oak. \"Bram is inside. Help me.\"

Running inside, innkeeper Bram is found standing on a table. He is surrounded by patrons, like some drunken preacher with his congregation.

\"Last call folks! It's on the house!\" Bram shouts. \"Pour a mug and drink your last. You can't take it with you. Last call for The Oak.\"

The patrons shout toasts of death and drink, most of the drink pouring wildly over their faces. Bram raises his mug and loses his footing, crashing to the floor as the table tips.

\"Help me get him up,\" Greycane says, lifting Bram to his feet. \"He's a bit overwhelmed.\"

Bram gurgles.

\"And I thought I was drunk,\" Greycane mumbles as he works to hoist him up.

These people will surely die if they stay.

The darkened and twisting alleyways are full of the homeless and their tormentors scurrying together like rats from a flood. It is difficult to keep track of directions as you turn again and again avoiding dead ends as people push past you.

The ground shakes and the alleyway ahead abruptly stops."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_15_1__c">"Climbing over the ruins of old buildings you see the great flank of the beast pass by.

    <string name="chp3a_16_1__a">"Location 16 – The Watering Hole

There is a pile of rubble where the Watering Hole once stood. Bits of bodies poke between the crumbled walls. The Stockade to the south fills with screams and smoke. There are supplies buried under the rubble, if only you can guess the location of the pantry."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_1__a">"Location 17 – The Eastern Tower

As you approach the great breach in Bastone's wall, where the beast undoubtedly gained entrance, you find a squad of guards making a last desperate stand, trying to hold back a tide of creatures vying to gain access to the town.

\"Harlbeck! The Oathsworn! I see them!\" a guard shouts from the top of the tower.

A grizzled old guardsman swings the shaft of his spear into the head of some dark wolf-like thing and looks up, \"Will you stand with us?\" he asks gravely.

The thing gnashes as he buries the point into its neck. The shattered wall behind him looks like a crumbled anthill as the terrors of the Deepwood force their way over the rubble. Claws, shrieking horrors and dark nightmares of mire and armored flesh press into Bastone. Whip-like tendrils wrap the legs of struggling guards as the flailing citizens of Bastone are torn apart like paper dolls.

The beast heads through the town toward you."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_3__a">"The packs of beasts scrabble up the mound of stones toward the breach, clambering over bodies on all sides. There are simply too many of them. You raise your blades and grit your teeth. You will blood them well before they take you.

Then, Lyceen steps in front of you. Limping, but with a cold fury plastered on her face. Something in her posture warns you to step back. A wind throws up her hair as she flings out her arms toward the oncoming creatures. There is the smell of iron and the hair on your arms stands up. Blood begins to rise from where it rested in pools between bodies on the slope. The beasts continue on, oblivious to what is happening. Twisting and curling, the blood takes shape, coalescing into tendrils and spikes. The blood boils and then Lyceen screams. A hundred shards of burning blood pierce through the mass of creatures. Primal yelps go up and a dozen bodies fall. More blood soaks the earth and more of the Deepwood denizens come on. Lyceen looks up at them with hatred, and with intense concentration, snaps her fingers. The blood explodes.

Lyceen vomits at what she has just done. The scene is one of carnage, like something from a Cistercian apocalyptic. She lulls, and one of you catches her as she falls unconscious. In one sense and one sense only, the way is now clear."</string>

Vines and tentacles, roots and hooves, teeth and stone form a maelstrom of surging death that pours through the once mighty wall.

\"Hold the line!\" Harlbeck screams as he parries a grasping claw with the shaft of his spear. The guards are valiant in the defense of their town, but you know it to be futile. There is no closing what has been opened here. You must get out of the town and this is your best option. You join the fight."</string>

You cannot outrun it. It is too close. A sense of finality, of certainty, settles on you. So it comes to this. You know what needs to be done. Someone has to distract it, must lure it away so the others may make good their escape, but that person… will surely die."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_6__a">"You swore an oath to protect this town. You can't save them all, but you can save some.

Grim-faced, you pluck up a flaming torch from the ground."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_6__c">"Hefting your weapon, you raise the torch aloft and charge back into the breach.

The beast, seeing the flame hurtling toward it, withdraws for a moment and that is all you need to dart down a side alley. The mighty creature rears up and crushes a terrace of houses before clawing its way after you.

You hear the rest of the Free Company making good their escape, not wasting a second of the precious chance you have bought them. The beast thunders behind you, but you are oddly peaceful. You make it a hundred paces before it reaches you. People spend all their years trying to find a meaning to life and you find it now…. in a good death."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_7__a">"The beast lumbers forward, smoke billowing from its nostrils. You turn to run and see Harlbeck's grim face staring up at it, torch in hand.

\"I hope you choke on me,\" he says and charges the thing.

The beast, seeing the flame hurtling toward it, withdraws for a moment and that is all Harlbeck needs to dart down a side alley. The mighty creature rears up and crushes a terrace of houses before clawing its way after the guardsman.

The last guard of Bastone has saved you. You have no time to lose. Scurrying down the stones of the breach, you make good your escape into the Deepwood. As you do so you know the gurgling final scream you hear from the street will be in your nightmares for months."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_17_8__a">"\"There's nothing left,\" Harlbeck pants. \"Just us.\" He motions to the few guards who remain standing, torn tabards and blood mixed with the muck of the Deepwood. \"But our spears are yours, if you'll have us,\" they say."</string>

    <string name="chp3a_19_2__a">"\"Looks like my selling days are over,\" Gamel pants as you go up to his shop. The door is shattered and it is clear the townspeople have scoured the place trying to arm themselves. \"Let's see what's left. I'm sure they didn't get through every lock.\""</string>
    <string name="chp3a_19_3__a">"As you get to the Banksmith, the place has clearly been broken into. Gamel sits on the edge of his now cold forge nursing a blow to the head. He looks up at you.

\"You come looting too? Because if you wanna take something, I'll make you pay for it one way or another,\" he says, hefting his hammer.

You tell him you're not here to loot and he sits back down.

\"Wouldn't matter anyway. Lost my son. What else matters?\""</string>
    <string name="chp3a_19_4__a">As you get to the Banksmith, the place has clearly been broken into. Not everything could be carried away by the looters however and there are several weapons and armor pieces scattered about.</string>

At a dead run, you turn a corner onto the thoroughfare that leads to the Main Gate and crash into a mass of bodies. A sea of people spreads out before you toward the Main Gate, many clutching belongings, screaming and shouting. There are people being trampled as waves of panic roll over the crowd.

Behind you, the Doom of Bastone crashes through a building. Bodies are flung carelessly aside, tossed by twitches of the beast's neck. The strange curling smoke that presses from its neck fills the packed street as you look for any direction you can move."</string>

    <string name="chp3a_27_1__c">You violently tug at the corroded iron bars of the sally port. This poorly maintained supply entrance has been tightly sealed by rust and decay. The beast burrows through the poorer streets of the town headed toward you.</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_3__c">You hack at the mechanism of the sally port. Great clangs peel the door, it creaks, then cracks open as you force its hinges to turn. On the other side, a pack of things from the Deepwood awaits you. Drawn by the clamor, they claw at you through the opening. The alleyway starts to fill with gibbering and chattering as the creatures force their way into Bastone.</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_4__a">"You hack at the mechanism of the sally port. Great clangs peel the door, it creaks, then opens a crack as you force its hinges to turn. It won't open quick enough.

The alleyway starts to fill with gibbering and chattering as the creatures force their way into Bastone."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_5__a">"The beasts scrabble through the sally port, forcing you back. You slay a handful as you retreat, but others clamber over the bodies. There are simply too many of them. You grip your blades and grit your teeth. You will blood them well before they take you. Then Lyceen steps in front of you. She limps, but a cold fury plasters her face. Something in her posture warns you to step back. A wind throws up her hair as she flings out her arms toward the oncoming creatures. There is the smell of iron and the hair on your arms stands up. Blood begins to rise from where it rested in pools between bodies on the floor. The beasts continue on, oblivious to what is happening. Twisting and curling, the blood takes shape, coalescing into tendrils and spikes. The blood boils and then Lyceen screams. A hundred shards of burning blood pierce through the mass of creatures. Primal yelps go up and a dozen bodies fall. More blood soaks the earth as more of the Deepwood denizens come on. Lyceen looks up at them with hatred, and with intense concentration, snaps her fingers. The blood explodes.

Lyceen vomits at what she has just done. The scene is one of carnage, like something from a Cistercian apocalyptic. She lulls, and one of you catches her as she falls unconscious. The pack is destroyed, but then…"</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_6__a">"The things you fight might be beasts of the Deepwood or the Deepwood itself. Skin-like bark, thorns and claws woven into unthinkable horrors. Vines and tentacles, roots and hooves, teeth and stone form a maelstrom of surging death pouring through the sally port.

You plunge into the melee."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_6__c">The pack retreats at the ferocity of your attack. The way looks clear, but then…</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_8__a">"Behind you a shadow looms. The street is consumed by the giant armored head of the Doom of Bastone. Wreathed in smoke and fumes, its eyes fall on you.

You cannot outrun it, it is too close. A sense of finality, of certainty, settles on you. So it comes to this. You know what needs to be done. Someone has to distract it, must lure it away so the others may make good their escape, but that person… will surely die."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_9__a">"You swore an oath to protect this town. You can't save them all, but you can save some.

Grim faced, you pluck up a flaming torch from the ground."</string>
    <string name="chp3a_27_9__c">"Hefting your weapon, you raise the torch aloft and charge back up the street.

The beast, seeing the flame hurtling toward it, withdraws for a moment and that is all you need to dart down a side alley. The mighty creature rears up and crushes a terrace of houses before clawing its way after you.

You hear the rest of the Free Company making good their escape, not wasting a second of the precious chance you have bought them. The beast thunders behind you, but you are oddly peaceful. You make it a hundred paces before it reaches you. People spend all their years trying to find a meaning to life and you find it now…. in a good death."</string>

The darkened and twisting alleyways are full of the homeless and their tormentors scurrying together like rats from a flood. It is difficult to keep track of directions as you turn again and again, avoiding dead ends as people push past you.

The ground shakes and the alleyway ahead of you stops.

A dead end.

You run in an attempt to trace your steps back the way you came, only to see the massive dark armored hide of the beast barreling through a nearby street. The walls around you collapse."</string>

Anyone left in the poorer burrows of Bastone cannot possibly survive the trampling of the beast. You see the beast is changing direction again, turning around toward you."</string>
    <string name="chp4_27_1__c">An ancient carved stone lies broken in two. You have seen stones like this before - waystones to mark the land before the coming of the Deepwood. The lettering is almost impossible to make out. There seem to be two locations named, if only you could work them out. Checking your compass, the top inscription points Southwest, the bottom one points South. You know Verum is Southeast of Bastone.</string>

    <string name="chp4_29_11__a">"You lean out over the water holding onto your companion's hand who in turn grips a gnarled branch for all they are worth. It's all or nothing. You plunge your other hand down, grasping the arm of the closest one and pull."</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_12__a">"It takes everything you have, straining every tired fiber of your muscles to overcome the pull of the bog. Covered in sweat, dozens of freshly open cuts, fetid water and mud, you drag the survivors clear. The Deepwood can't have this one, not today."</string>

    <string name="chp4_29_14__a">"You nod to your Adendri, and with bare feet, she deftly steps on a few branches to bring herself closer to the victim. Raising a hand, a thin stream of spores pour from her hair to the surrounding vines. A handful detach from their moorings and drop down toward her target, blindly searching in the air. The moment they touch your companion's hand, the vines begin wrapping around their arm, over and over. The Adendri then makes a single fluid motion with her hand and they are hauled from the mud. Despite being covered in mud and fetid water, at least they haven't been consumed by the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_15__a">You hear the slap of a body hitting mud and see your companion being pulled beneath the bog, already neck high in the muck. They are far off the path, but one of you might reach them in time.</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_1__c">The ground here is more muck than dirt. Each step becomes a test of mind and body. Thick trees with massive trunks have given way to slick, ropy tendrils that hang and tug at you as you push them aside. Pressing on, you probe each footfall to make sure there is something to support you, not just brown and gray sludge that could engulf you. Through the vines, you can see the waterlogged bog extends far into the hanging mist with no end in sight.</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_2__a">"You've been in the Deepwood long enough to spot the nearly imperceptible signs of safe footing. There is an intricate map drawn into the surface of the swamp, only visible to those who have spent too many days in these cursed woods.

Unfortunately, most of those following you have never set foot beyond the city gates. Though your instructions are clear, you inevitably hear a cry. One of Bastone's survivors has fallen off the path. You sharply command everyone to freeze where they stand and rush toward the gurgling cry.

By the time you get to him, the man's head and arms are all that remain above the surface. Roots pulse around him. Perhaps he didn't misstep. Perhaps the Deepwood hungers. You can try to free him from the oily bog, but he is too far off the path. Perhaps one of you might be able to reach him."</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_3__a">"THE OATHSWORN WITH THE LOWEST DRAW:

The crumbling of Bastone has taken a great toll on you. Your nerves are frayed, vision is blurred, and your breath comes in deep ragged gulps. A slight misstep off the nearly invisible path and a clutch of roots takes hold of your boot. Suddenly you are pulled into the slick oil-coated bog. You curse yourself, and immediately recall that you must not panic. Movement will only suck you down quicker."</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_4__a">"It takes everything you have, straining every tired fiber of your muscles to overcome the pull of the bog. Covered in sweat, freshly open cuts and mud, you drag the survivor clear. The Deepwood can't have this one, not today."</string>
    <string name="chp4_29_5__a">"There is nowhere to gain purchase, not enough to free the man. The more he struggles the tighter the mud sucks at him. As the mud reaches his mouth, he panics and lets go of your hand. He thrashes his arms wildly, but this only draws him down quicker and the mud covers his head. You make one last desperate lunge for his outstretched hand as it sinks away beneath the surface. He is gone. You curse, not just at the loss of life. He had also been carrying some of the group's supplies."</string>

    <string name="chp4_35_1__c">"Most of the trees that surround you are torn, ruinous things. The limbs come at impossible angles from twisted trunks. The colors are dark and wrong somehow.

An oak tree.

Untouched, strong, clean.

    <string name="chp4_35_2__a">"There is a story here, lost to time. You'd like to think something great happened. The grass is green and pure by the tree. A cache of weapons and armor has been stowed here. There is no telling how long they have been protected from the Deepwood."</string>
    <string name="chp4_35_3__a">"In the strange insanity of the Deepwood, there is something deeply disturbing about the cleanliness of this place. Whatever it is, you don't trust it. The Deepwood has many ways to kill a man, not least of all are its lies."</string>
    <string name="chp4_45_1__c">"You are alive… lost, but alive. Between fleeing the fall of Bastone and the Wyrm attack, you got turned around. Thankfully you have your life line, your compass. Verum is Southeast of Bastone, but without the guidance of the Wire Road, you could be off by leagues and never know you have passed it by. You have to find it. The Wire Roads were laid down hundreds of years ago during the first crusades to reunite mankind and reclaim their homeland from the Deepwood. Inevitably they were pressed back into their cities and now the wires are all that remain standing from those bloody campaigns. Built on the old roads, you know they run as straight as the Deepwood would allow.

As you deliberate, Greycane rummages in his satchel to reveal a stack of papers he saved from the collapse of Bastone. Many seem to be poems and stories but several are maps. \"I thought these would come in handy,\" he says. \"Take a look at this. I have no idea where we are on it, but if we can find out, we might be able to find our way back to the wire.\""</string>
    <string name="chp4_46_1__c">A waystone from a previous age stands before you. You pull the moss and scum from its surface to reveal the inscription below. Time has worn thin its lettering and you can only make out small indentations on its surface. Greycane comes to your side proffering the map. There seem to be two locations on the waystone. Checking your compass, the top one points Southwest, the bottom inscription points South. You know Verum is Southeast of Bastone.</string>
    <string name="chp4_48_1a__c">"You smell smoke. Fire does not come randomly in the Deepwood. The wood is difficult to ignite, even with a good dry flint and steel.

If you wish to investigate the fire, choose the top option. Otherwise, choose a direction to go in."</string>
    <string name="chp4_48_2__a">"Beneath the bows of several large trees, you find the remnants of a camp. The fire's embers are dark, but still warm. A ragged lean-to of blankets and a few support sticks lie trampled on the ground and a trail of blood leads off into the woods as though something were dragged from the camp. Whoever it was, they are certainly dead. This happened recently.

Hurriedly, you search the camp."</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_1__c">"The shambling remains of a bridge stand in front of you, although the river it once covered is long gone. Great stone supports jut out at an angle, caught in a slow, centuries-long fall as the Deepwood pulls the structure in.

A Bastone guard stands on the bridge. He has heard your approach. In one hand, he holds a drawn sword. In the other, gripped tightly, is a church talisman. His stance is shaky and his face is caked in mud and blood. Several other guards lay about, but there are no signs of life left in their scattered remains.

\"Stand back,\" he shouts pointing his sword shakily toward you.

As you emerge from the woods, he sees who you are. He lowers the sword to his side and leans heavily against one of the stone supports.

\"I thought you were them. Come to finish the job.\""</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_4__a">"The guard's head snaps back in terror at the sight of the Exile. \"Demon!\" he exclaims, dropping his sword involuntarily. He begins to pray a ward, clutching the talisman to his lips. \"No one shall fear who stays on the path or clings to the pillar of righteousness…\"

Your Exile steps up to the man, fully a head taller than him, and reaches down. The man holds out the talisman to ward him off, but the Exile simply snatches it from his hand and, with a quick twist, snaps it in two, tossing the pieces to either side of the bridge. \"If I were a demon you would be dead by now. Call me that again and you'll find out what I really am.\" The guard stops praying, but is still visibly shaking. \"You have seen these scars before?\" The Exile continues, tapping a fist to his own chest. The guard nods. Turning away, the Exile looks at you. \"The tribe are here.\""</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_4__c">"It takes some time, but without the Exile's gaze on him and with some reassurance, the guard composes himself."</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_5__a">He breathes heavily as you approach, your hands outstretched to show you mean him no harm. The fallen guards beneath the bridge have been torn savagely asunder. Their wounds are from primitive weapons: horns and rusted blades. Made by wild strikes with brute power and precision.</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_8__a">This was the work of a Scar Tribe. Barbarians who eke out life between the trees by preying on anything weak enough to fall beneath their blades. Cunning and merciless, this is not a foe you want to fight right now. If they have your scent though, you may not have a choice.</string>
    <string name="chp4_64_9__a">"\"What happened, soldier?\" you ask.

Remembering his training, the guard stands straighter. He starts to say something then, stops himself. \"Luck, sir,\" he says. \"My squad and I were on the wall. That beast toppled it and we were thrown into the trees. Heaven knows how I survived, but I fell through a branch and made it to the ground. The rest of my squad was dead. I wandered about and ran into another squad heading out of town. Joined them and made it here. That's when they came. Hooks came out of the trees and ripped the sergeant away. He screamed. Then they were on us. We took this bridge to gain the high ground. But those things, they may have walked on two legs, but weren't like any man I ever seen. They were like animals carving up the boys. One hit me and I fell off the bridge. I blacked out and he must have thought me dead. When I came to, I heard a horn blow and they ran into the woods not long after that, heading that way.\" He points across the bridge. \"I'm lucky, I guess,\" he says, standing among the ruins of his comrades.

You go to the bodies of the guards and find some workable items."</string>
    <string name="chp4_67_1a__c">"Crimson bloodthorns poke, spearlike, from the ground on all sides. Like waving stilettos, they probe the air, waiting for a touch of warmth. You have been trained and have encountered them before, but not with so many in tow. There may be a price to pay. Those brave or foolish enough to get close know the long slim thorns are not solid, but rather hollowed spikes perfect for bloodletting. Their reeds form a maze and perhaps there is a way through.

    <string name="chp4_72_1__c">"A village once stood here. You've already walked past what must have been smaller houses on the outskirts, although their remains are nothing but darkened stone walls now. No timbers, roofs or doors remain. Only a skeleton of this place still stands.

As you approach the heart of the town, you imagine the many lives that would have bustled about here once. Walking through the dead village is like looking at a dead man. That same feeling pervades. The silence and stillness are eerily wrong.

There is faint crying.

You draw your weapons and take cover behind a nearby wall.

Peering around it, you see a mass of people huddled in the village square, many look outward into the woods. More survivors of Bastone. They wield shovels and brooms in poor defense. They seem to be anticipating an attack from something or someone."</string>

If you leave the people, they will die and the tribe will soon hunt you. This is your chance to take them first. Practiced hand gestures made in silence create your plan of attack and you move into position. Bedecked in giant horns and fur, the brutish leader of the Scar Tribe blows a horn. Roaring, the tribesmen leap from the trees and land among the refugees. Cries of terror fill the air. You seize the moment to attack."</string>
    <string name="chp4_72_3__a">You see the branches of the Deepwood come alive as a fully armed Scar Tribe pounces onto the refugees below. Carnage breaks out as screams and warcries fill the air. You must act now. Bellowing a challenge, you heft your weapons and charge into the fray.</string>
    <string name="chp4_epi_0__a">The Scar Tribe lies broken at your feet. There is something different about killing men rather than beasts, even ones such as these. You gather together and tally the dead. Nearly a dozen refugees lost, but many more were saved today. Among them is a woman. Her beauty shows, even beneath the dirt and grime of travel. Long, blonde hair fans out on the floor around her where you find her fainted next to the body of a Scar tribesman. Upon reviving her, you discover her name is Lady Elanna, ward of Lord Montfort who was killed helping her flee Bastone. Taking each of your hands in turn, she fixes you with her eyes and thanks you for saving her life. In return she wishes to help you in any way she can.</string>

    <string name="chp4_epi_0__e">The refugees gather round you, reaching out hands of thanks. They know what would have happened had you not arrived. With signs of respect, they will follow the authority of your Oathmarks and place themselves in your charge. The responsibility is a grave one, but you are shown another compelling reason to bear it. A pile of rations large enough to get you to Verum.</string>
    <string name="chp4_epi_0__g">You assemble the now sizable company of refugees and order them onward. This village was once Narenford, and that means the Wire Road is likely nearby.</string>

Thrum. Cold and metallic.

It is the familiar sound.

Thrum.

The low plucking of the Wire Road.

Thrum.

You track it through the trees.

Samil stands, plucking the Wire Road.

Thrum.

You blink and he is gone.

You look back. None of the survivors have seen this. You're not sure you have seen it yourself. Is this the echo of the Satyr's touch or is it a ghost hounding your steps? You don't know, but you are sure that you have found the way out. Leading the company to it, you reach out to the wire and you feel a warm spark. As you touch the metal, you feel hope."</string>

You find your attention drawn to Lyceen. She is struggling with the journey. Her wounds from the burning back in Bastone and whatever she did at the wall have obviously taken their toll. As if aware of your thoughts, she straightens her posture and walks up the column toward you.

\"I need to explain myself,\" she says, slightly embarrassed. \"It's the least you deserve after what you did for me. My life is in your hands already. This cannot make things worse. People sharing ghost stories would call me a bloodwitch. I cannot do what they think though. I can twist blood when it is outside of the body, but I cannot turn men to puppets or boil the blood in your veins. I don't know how it works. I can just feel the blood…\" She trails off. \"I want you to know I have never hurt a person on purpose.\"

As one of the men draws some amber rocks from his backpack, you raise your hand. \"No fires.\" These people don't realize how dangerous it is to draw attention to yourself here. \"If you sleep by a fire, you're just warming the meal for the thing that eats you while you sleep. We'll sleep in the trees. Now, get up and climb.\" Before long the party is off the floor and hidden amongst the dark limbs of the sprawling trees.

Later that night you wake to a thud from the darkness beneath you. Something big is moving below. Terrified eyes look to you from amongst the branches and you raise a finger to your lips. Hands clasp over mouths, some begin to shake in fear. The thing below you sniffs, a deep predatory rumble rolls from its throat. Then, a snapping, wrenching noise can be heard. There is an animal's squeal in the dark and then silence. The beast has found prey, but thankfully it is not you. It lumbers away followed by a collective sigh from those clutching the tree limbs. You look to Greycane, leaning against a trunk with his legs stretched out before him. He has slept through the whole thing."</string>

You build up the fire as best you can and bed down hoping it will be large enough to discourage the things that wait in the woods. The warmth is welcome and soothes your aching body."</string>
    <string name="chp4m_1_3__c">Later that night, a snarl is all that precedes the attack. The circling pack sticks to the shadows, away from the firelight, but long arms reach out and manage to pluck several of the party away before you can even react. The screams disappear into the darkness.</string>

Early in the afternoon, as the party rests, Bram approaches you. He looks embarrassed and eyes your Oathmarks.

\"I… I don't mean to be telling you your business, but I reckon we need to think about rationing. You're all soldier types so you know an army marches on its stomach. These people are not like you or Greycane, though. They'll eat their stores too quickly.\" You nod. It's easy to forget how little civilians think about these things. You decide to act."</string>

A few nods of understanding come from the group but a few refuse to give way to you. After a heated exchange some of the refugees grab their packs and head off into the trees alone. You don't favor their chances."</string>

You look over your company, exhaustion now showing on their faces beneath the grime and sweat. To one side you notice Dane. He is sharing his ration with one of the women from Bastone. She is crying. He puts a protective arm around her, and whispers something into her ear. She nods and wipes her eyes. It is comforting to see moments of humanity in the brief connection between the two. One that is in stark contrast to the promise of death that pervades everything else here."</string>

You continue on at a pace, the woman trailing with the rest of the civilians. Her coughing stops after a time and, although colored by grief, she seems to be able to continue. She may not face the same end as her husband, though life as a widow in Verum might not be much better."</string>
    <string name="chp4m_4_1__a">"Time Triggered Story

You press deeper and deeper into the Deepwood. The refugees form a broken line behind you trying to step where you do. You have warned them not to touch anything here. They are tired now though, exhaustion is setting in and mistakes are being made. The Deepwood reacts to incursions into its domain and even more so to concentrated groups. You wonder if it was a good idea to bring these refugees with you. Free Companies for hundreds of years have known to travel the woods in small squads to minimize its reaction to their presence, this may…

Someone wretches loudly from back down in the line. Turning, you see a man doubled over on his knees. \"He fell,\" a woman shouts, \"And it squirted that stuff at him.\" People are retreating from the man as you stride down the line toward him. At the man's feet is a cyst. The pink mound quivers having disgorged its contents. He continues to retch as he tries to wipe off the small black spore clusters from his face and neck."</string>
    <string name="chp4m_4_2__a">"Time Triggered Story

A woman, obviously the man's wife, goes to aid her husband. Before she can touch him, one of you takes her by the arm and pulls her clear. She balks at her constraint.

\"Let me help him!\" she says, angrily.

\"You can't,\" you reply. \"No one can.\"

The man continues to retch. The spores are working their way through his system and you know they will slowly consume the man until his body collapses, creating a new cyst on the Deepwood floor.

Drawing your weapon, one of you brings it down on the man's head in a single smooth motion. The coughing stops and a thin stream of a dark ash-like substance trickles from his mouth. His wife tries to scream, but you put a hand over her mouth to silence her. The last thing you need is to alert more danger to the group. One of you leads her gently away further up the column. A swift death at your hand was better than the fate that awaited him."</string>

Fashioning a stretcher from dead branches, you hoist the man and carry on. The pace is slow, the man continues to cough as you travel. You fear something will hear him."</string>
    <string name="chp4m_4_6__c">"Traveling this way most of the day, you stop when the man's coughing ceases. Putting him down, his wife leans in to inspect him. She screams. Her husband seems to be deflating as if his bones had been removed. You step away from the corpse, now more a fleshy mound than a person. The Deepwood claims another victim. You can only hope it will be the last. The man's wife begins to cough.

His wife clings to him as he leans on a root, retching. You ask the woman to come with you but she will not leave her husband. You bow your head to her in respect and soberly turn away.

The days are long and the group shows signs of emotional exhaustion as well as physical. Being terrified all day takes a toll on the civilians. \"Fleck for a fable,\" Greycane says smiling.

The group has paused for a rest and the fableman reclines against a tree, his legs stretched out before him. He knows these people can't spare iron for a tale as is the fashion with fablemen. \"Well seeing as you may be my last audience, I'll tell you anyway.\" He sits up and leans in, drawing the small crowd into his confidence.

\"The Eternal City, they call it. Verum. A million people living, dying, loving and crying all in one place. It's the greatest fortress mankind ever built. Walls so high you can't see the top. It has never been breached, not once. It is one of the few truly safe places left. Beneath the city are hundreds of miles of labyrinths, the first Underways ever to be built. They go so deep, they say it even reaches all the way down to a sunless sea where the Great Ones roam. They have so much food in Verum they have to parade the cattle through the streets in a line from the Underways all the way to the markets of Old Town.\"

On hearing about food, the group perks up. Greycane notes this and smiles.

\"Nobles prune orchards of plums and figs and even the common folk spice their water with ginger. Once a boy fell from a window three stories up only to land, completely safe, in a pile of puddings.\" Now the rest of the group are smiling.

\"Above it all stands King Favian, a mighty warrior and more than that…a good man. One who sees justice is done for high and low alike. He is the son of Great King Mandran, who crushed the Underways' gangmasters. Finally making the water flow freely to the surface again after the hundred year drought…\"

The ears of the group are piqued as Greycane continues to weave a tale of Verum. With fascinating skill he paints a picture of a hopeful land and the promise of a good living to come if only they can get out of the Deepwood. You see the importance of what he is doing and let him continue. You almost want to believe it yourself, but one thing stops you… You've been there."</string>

You take a sip. It feels cool and refreshing, and most importantly, it doesn't make anything grow from your eyeballs. It's safe."</string>
    <string name="chp5_14_1__a">"Location 14 – Bridge

You make your way toward the noble quarter to meet Lord Rhiner. Inevitably, you come to one of the old stone bridges that spans the river Sine, or at least what's left of it. Many years ago the Deepwood sucked dry the river and now the 'Gutters' take its place. Thousands of Verum's poorest huddle there in shacks clustered in the mud of the riverbed, in the shadow of once great ships, forever moored in the mire. 

\"Smoke from flesh, you saw it,\" snaps a man as he leaps from a spot by the bridge. He is wearing a selection of rags and rats that would make a ratcatcher jealous. Doomsayers aren't uncommon in Verum, it's fairly easy to be right regarding predictions of death and destruction with the Deepwood at the gates. You try to dismiss the man, but then he pipes up, \"And running from the maw… it chased you through the walls until over your shoulders a city falls.\" That part of your tale was not common knowledge.

\"Who are you?\" you ask. 

Unevenly, the crazed man scampers up to you. His face a mask of grime and wiry beard, his age unknowable under the muck of the gutter. He makes a sign of Pot's Peace and bites his thumb.

\"Herald.\"

\"Herald, of what?\"

\"I prefer the young and old,

The wet, the dry, the hot, the cold.

Rarely sought, though often found.

I visit all above the ground.\"

There is something about the look behind his eyes, he knows more than he should about you, and he knows something else he seems to want to tell you."</string>
    <string name="chp5_14_3__a">"The Herald seems confused by your answer. \"Perhaps… yes… if wrong is right and up is down that makes sense. Has it finally happened then, the unmaking?\" He shakes his head, \"No, the sun is not black, not yet. Others may come holding the key to the door with no lock. Shoo! Shoo! I must be ready for them.''

The Herald returns his gaze to the crowds. It seems you must press on to the noble quarter. Whatever it was the Herald wanted to show you seems lost in his glazed eyes."</string>
    <string name="chp5_14_4__c">"A gap toothed grin stretches the Herald's face. \"Death. Yes, death is the answer, and life is the question. Are you them? No matter. Time or death or both will tell as they always do. I have forgotten the answer, I was so much older then.\"

He looks quickly to the side, as if there was a loud noise. Following his glance there is nothing there.

\"I know, I know. But I know not where. I say, I do, but I don't. Time to go. Verum is vast and the memories so many. Lead on.\"

\"Where to?\" you ask.

The man calling himself the Herald gives you a quizzical look as if you should know this part already. 

\"Neither here nor near in shell of shell.

No green hand here does dwell.

Blood trickles out amongst the stones,

seeping still from pile of bones.\"

For all his ramblings the Herald seems to want to show you something important."</string>
    <string name="chp5_1_1__a">"Location 1 – The Deepwood

Hunger and cold gnaw at you and the remaining survivors from Bastone. The constant rain has not helped and the column slogs along behind you in thick trails of mud. The retreat from Bastone has not been easy. A week of keeping these people alive with one hand on the Wire Road has been exhausting. Rations are now reduced to stale crumbs. Bandages are all used and morale is frayed.

Yesterday, several refugees gave in to the horror and simply ran into the woods to embrace the inevitable. It was swift, which is what they wanted. In the back of your mind, all you noticed was less mouths to feed. As you force yourselves and those in your charge forward into the woods, you see a shift in the colors ahead. Not green after green. Something stark. Walls."</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_10__a">"Covered in rain, sweat and blood, you gaze around at the survivors. A cheer goes up. They clasp hands to your shoulders, crying and thanking you. Everyone knows who saved them. Officials come from the gate offices with sticks and tallying boards to check the survivors' condition and to make sure they brought none of the Deepwood in with them. After a time the survivors begin to disperse into the city, but not before they gather up iron from amongst them as a reward."</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_10__c">"The captain from the wall approaches. He removes his helm.

\"It wants to see you. Follow me.\" He leads you through the swarms of people, and up a stairway that clings to the side of the outer walls of Verum. He stops at the top and points, unwilling to go any further.

It is unclear if it is shadows that hide The Watcher's visage or if its very face is made of them. It walks slowly to the edge of the wall and looks at the new crowd you have brought with you.

\"Report,\" a rasping voice commands from within the cowl.

It listens as you detail the fall of Bastone, the keening cry of the witch and the trials of the Deepwood. Although its robes pulse and flow with the wind, it seems not to move nor react to any of your tales of woe.

\"Leave me,\" it says finally. You, all too gladly, retreat from it. There are many unnerving things in the world, but the Watchers really set your teeth on edge."</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_11__a">In the weeks that follow, you acclimatize to civilization. Not long after the events at the gate, a runner brings you an envelope. Opening it you find a note in fine script: In acknowledgement of your great service to the Crown and the fallen city of Bastone, and on the authority of his royal highness, King Favian, you are given deed of title to the following property: One tavern of Tonsin Lane, Old town.</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_12__a">"\"Needs a tad of cleaning, but nothing these old hands can't fix,\" Bram says as he rolls up his sleeves and enters the abandoned tavern behind you.

\"It's a fine hall,\" Midge nods, bounding in and surveying the surroundings. \"I would reckon you hang trophies over there, eh? Maybe a nice table by the fire to play some Pyramids and such. You can make this place quite the center of town with my help.\"

\"I do feel,\" Greycane adds as he gently shoulders by you, \"the addition of a few serving girls might brighten the place a bit.\"

With your friends suddenly moving old furniture and fueling the fires with their imagination, you realize that they actually might be right.

\"Our lady is back, bless her, she's back,\" Bram says with a tear in his eye.

\"Who?\" asks Midge.

Bram turns to the lad with a faint smile on his face, \"The Broken Oak.\""</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_13__c">"The captain is a hard man but seeing the mark on your wrists is enough to widen his eyes. He signals the gatekeepers, waving a blue cloth. Even from this distance you can hear the turning of great gears as weights shift.

    <string name="chp5_3_1__a">"Location 3 – The King's Gate

The trees thin, not by nature, but by hatchet and axe. The Deepwood is fought here in a battle for sanity. Pulling from the treeline you see the mighty walls of Verum. You glance back behind you into the woods. The line you lead is long and weak. The trees are swaying in a disconcerting manner, as if trying to keep you in.

You urge the broken people forward. They cheer as they see the walls, cries of thanks and sobbing break out at the sight of them. Some sixty feet high and bristling with spikes at the base, the walls stand vigil against all that would threaten the city. Framed in the light of the rising sun you can make out patrols of heavily armed guards walking the parapets and watchmen on the walls. Massive gates rise high in their midst and the great iron Bull of Verum glares at you from atop the gates' towers.

As you approach, still thirty paces away, a horn sounds through the air, causing all to look up and halt. Atop the walls above the gate, a dozen guards part, and make way for a man with a gleaming helmet topped with a feathered blue plume. He strides forward and extends a warning arm to your company.

\"Bastone has fallen, we are all that is left, open the gates,\" you call.

\"What in the name of the One is this?\" he shouts, ignoring the fact that you have spoken at all, gesturing to the refugees milling behind you. \"You expect to be allowed anywhere near the walls of Verum? These gates do not open for mobs that emerge from the Deepwood.\"

\"I knew it,\" the captain swears. \"Close the gate, close the gate! They've awakened the Deepwood!\"

You turn, and see people in the treeline being thrown.

Petitions from the refugees rise to a loud crescendo.

\"We cannot risk a breach,\" The captain retaliates. \"You've brought danger to this city, and it is my job to protect it, not you.\"

You turn, draw your weapons, and head to the back of the line."</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_7__a">"Fiends of flesh and fur claw at the ragged line of survivors. People are dragged into the trees to never be seen again and you know it will not take long now that the Deepwood has woken. Between cleaving arcs of your weapons you look back at the gates. There is no hope of them opening if they fear a breach, even for Oathsworn. You spy the guard captain atop the walls staring defiantly at the refugees. He looks back over his shoulder for a moment and draws back, bowing fearfully. In his place glides the unmistakable form of one of the Watchers. Draped in black robes and a heavy weighted cowl, you cannot see its face beneath the hood, but you can feel its gaze upon you. It continues considering, and after a moment raises its raven headed staff. The gates begin to grind open.

The captain of the guard rushes to set warriors at the opening and you bellow for the survivors to \"run for the gates!\" With your backs to the city at the rear of the line, you stand as a shield for the survivors, and as the last few step through you bolt for the opening."</string>
    <string name="chp5_3_8__c">As you break from the trees, archers fire down into the masses of flesh that chase you. You fling yourselves through the gate just in time as it clamps shut. Beyond the wall, bestial howls rise in frustration.</string>

Rarely awake during the day, he scurries off at sundown each night and returns come morning with a handful of rats for you. It's his way of showing gratitude for bringing him to the massive labyrinthine sewers of Verum. They make excellent additions to some of Bram's stews, and he supplies the tavern with a fair amount of ingredients this way."</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_1__a">"Location 7 – The Broken Oak

The new Broken Oak smells of wood, ale and sweat. Just as any tavern should. It has taken weeks of Bram commanding a team of men paid in food, Greycane gathering people to lend a hand, and Midge taking credit for everything else. The people of Bastone come to offer thanks and share a simple meal of root and potato porridge. They are settling into Verum and come to you sharing stories of their new homes. They speak of the overwhelming hugeness of it all. Of new jobs, new lives, the strange plant-like A'Dendri living in the Green Streets, and even of a strange sickness being found in the Cobbles. The Oak becomes a gathering place for the remnants of Bastone, and without meaning to, you gain a band of regulars more than happy to raise a mug in your honor and tell of the comings and goings of the city. For a time, all is well, and you can forget the nightmares of the fall of Bastone."</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_2__a">"Days later, you descend the main stairs to the Hunters' Hall. Arrayed before you is a comfortable scene of patrons and allies dotted about the room.

At the bar Greycane takes a sip from a mug, and coughs, sputtering, \"Seven hells, what is that?\" Across the bar, Bram furrows his eyebrows. \"Did you decant this from an Ursus' chamberpot?\" Greycane continues.

\"It's not that bad, I rather like it,\" Molly, one of the serving girls says, smiling encouragingly at Bram.

\"Don't encourage him, Molly. Or he might make another and finish me off,\" Greycane replies.

Taking a swig himself, Bram says, \"It needs a little something, I'll get it right, just needs some experimentation.\"

Greycane looks over his shoulder, noticing you. \"Aye, good morning, some news came earlier, looks like there's a contract. There's time enough for that though. I know some of the others want to talk to you.\""</string>

He sweeps up after the doors close and seems content, and more importantly, safe."</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_5__a">Dane, recently back from a night patrol with the local guard, sits with the woman you now know to be Jocie. They whisper in soft tones, laugh and jostle each other over a meal. More than once they have left to wander the streets of Verum merely to get lost in each other.</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_6__a">"Lyceen beckons you over to a table where she cuts some fresh herbs. \"You've seen what I am and still you let me stay here… thank you.\" Lyceen speaks slowly. \"I wanted to repay you.

I'll be able to tend your wounds and do a service to the city.\""</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_7__a">"Celeste, dressed in her best, is cleaner than you have ever seen her.

\"Going somewhere?\" you ask.

\"To get my hands dirty. I've made progress with the Underways' bosses here. They're having a jackbug problem and I think I have the answer. Today I finally get back underground. Your hospitality has been noted, but the Underways is on the other side of the city, and I must be closer to work for efficiency. I… thank you, and want you to have this.\" She takes out a pale root from her satchel. \"This is a maiden's kiss, it's rare and good for what ails you. I hope you don't find need of it, but well, there it is just in case.\" She straightens, and without looking back, heads out the door."</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_8__a">Standing sentinel by the main entrance is Steet, the now very capable muscle of The Broken Oak. He gives you a nod of respect as you catch his eye. His family has settled outside the Cobbles, and he works for you for little more than food to bring them each night. He shies away from additional payment, saying that you have done too much for his family already.</string>
    <string name="chp5_7_9__a">"You walk up to Greycane at the bar. He starts, \"A few days back a group went deepside. A Free Company and forty loggers went to gather lumber. Only two returned. Lord Rhiner, a bit of an ass if you ask me, needs the wood still. He asked for you personally. He wants the 'Heroes of Bastone' to look into it and keep the new boys safe.\" Word of your exploits has gotten around, and the moniker has followed you these last weeks. It seems the city cryers have been ordered to expound and embellish your company's exploits to keep men's minds away from the loss of one of the great cities. This forced a notoriety upon you, whether you wanted it or not.

\"I know setting up The Broken Oak has taken a lot of your iron recently,\" Greycane continues, \"and though Rhiner may not be bright, he is rich. I suggest you see what the good man has to say about the situation.\"

You agree you need a contract, more than just the iron, you need the practice. Comfort can kill a Free Company."</string>

A small fortress of thick stone walls looking almost like a miniature version of Bastone squats here. The people give it a wide berth. Guards in brown and deep blue file in and out, changing shifts and reporting disturbances. Several flank the doorway holding large, cruel billhooks which would be difficult to wield in battle, but serve the purpose of intimidating the crowds.

\"See, this place is safe enough already, why come here?\" the Herald asks.

The Grand Bazaar is an exciting crush of people, sounds, sights and smells. Bright tents and shop signs dot the sides of the road as well as the middle of the street, making movement incredibly slow, but it gives you time to see the vendors' wares.

This church must have been the first building here. The stones are crumbling or replaced with others of different colors and qualities. What was once magnificent displays of stained glass are now patched with wooden boards and cloth. People stream in the front door. Here they get a watery warm stew of potato and salt. A young, frail girl without shoes pushes fearlessly past you and hurries to the church steps.

\"Her name is Anya,\" the Herald explains. \"I don't think we've met. And should not. Let us go.\"

\"Iron smells like dirt,\" the Herald snorts as you approach the lead Banksmith in the area. It is an impressive shop with many assistants forging iron into ingots and wares among the pounding on a half dozen anvils.

\"And smells of burning meat,\" the Herald continues. \"I've never had enough iron in my fist to come here. And yet here we are. I do not know why.\""</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_1__a">"Location 2 – The Cobbles

A thick malaise shrouds the Cobbles, the sounds of the rest of the city seem dampened and distant as if the air is bloated with pestilence. Word of the sickness had reached you through Greycane but you couldn't imagine it had spread so fast. Not everyone is affected of course, but so many of the faces you see in doorways and windows carry grief, and wet coughs break the cloying silence. 

You each pull out cloths and fashion makeshift masks to breathe through. The Herald signals you to follow.

Several streets later you ask him what he is looking for.

\"The more you take from it, the bigger it gets,\" he mutters, searching the walls."</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_3__a">"Frustrated with you, the Herald skitters about the streets redoubling his efforts. You spend too long here, waiting on this madman's hunt. The vapors of the street begin to have an effect on you."</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_3__c">A burst of laughter tells you the Herald has found what he is looking for. Urging you to hurry, he points to a large hole.</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_4__a">"Ducking through the hole reveals a small courtyard beyond, shouldered between three neighboring tenements. Lining the area are small mounds of bodies in various states of decay.

\"The dead,\" the Herald says simply as he emerges through the hole.

From the position and broken nature of the bodies you can see many have been dropped here from the tenement windows high above. Casualties of the Cobbles' curse. 

Your brows furrow. Has this all been a waste of time? A madman's search for plague bodies. They should be burnt of course, but this is barely something the watch would care about, let alone a Free Company. You turn to the Herald, as if reading your mind he points a finger to one of the piles. There you catch sight of something moving. 

You draw your weapons and approach with caution. It bursts from the pile."</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_5__a">"Your hand shoots out and catches the flying maggot in mid air, just before it plunged into your allies' face. Some two-feet-long with gaping mandibles, it wriggles violently in your grip, screeching. Tensing, you crush the life from the grub and its wings stop buzzing."</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_6a__a">A flying maggot bursts from the mound of corpses. Mandibles snapping, it hurtles into your face. It splatters into ichor as you crush it with your weapons, but not before it bites deep into your exposed flesh.</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_6b__a">You know what this is.</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_6b__c">"It may be the source of the plague. Bloatflies have been known to enter cities in search of easy prey, flying over the walls by night to catch the unwary. What you caught was only its larvae laid in the bodies to gorge until grown enough to leave the nest.

Bloatflies do not travel far from a good food source. No doubt retreating to the woods by day and returning at night. There is no specific contract for this beast but the Pact leaves a standing writ of reward for all beast heads that can be proven to threaten a city.

    <string name="chp5a_2_9__a">You raise your Oathmarks as you approach the impenetrable gate of the city. A guardsman tolls a bell three times and the gate grumbles open just wide enough for you to pass. The guards at the outside post watch as you gird yourselves to travel into the treeline. Marking your compass, you head off to the Northwest. As the gate closes, The Herald scrambles through to join you.</string>
    <string name="chp5a_2_9__c">"You are barely into the trees when you hear shouting. Bloatflies are not known for travelling great distances, so it is no surprise to find it so close to the city as it swoops down into the middle of a company of loggers whose hatchets and axes are swung too slow as it zips through them. It is a grotesque scene as the abomination plunges its sting deep into a man's gut. His body begins to swell and distort as he writhes in agony, lifted from the ground as the Bloatfly hovers on massive translucent wings. The insectile head flits to your Free Company and you see… nothing… nothing at all in those cold, faceted eyes. Not waiting to find out what happens next, you charge the gargantuan insect."</string>
    <string name="chp5a_3_1__a">"Location 3 – The King's Gate

The King's Gate creaks and pops as huge counterweights pull massive chains. The sculpted bull atop the wall glares toward the Deepwood as a large group of loggers and guards steel themselves to head into the deep. 

\"Why do you take me here?\" The Herald asks confused. \"Here is no time for now, here is then and now is there.\"

Very few people seem to walk the paths to the Green Streets. The cobblestone roads are overtaken with soft moss carpets that gently slope up the sides of vine covered buildings. The sky shows through an intricate lace of flowering branches and hanging plants that sway and reach for one another though there is no breeze.

Bridges of branches crisscross overhead, connecting higher level apartments as mouthless A'Dendri of all shades of flora bound and glide on paths not meant to support human feet. Two A'Dendri drop from a vine road overhead and land soundlessly in front of you. One pounds out a rapid series of taps and scratches on its hand and forearm before leaning forward inquiringly.

The Herald, surprisingly lucid, chimes in. \"I don't speak Knock. I wonder if they were offering us pie. I like pie. But no matter, too much life here, not enough death.\"

Once inside, a dark-skinned man, in green robes covered with straps and holding small vials, addresses you. \"I am Brother Lax. Word comes that you saved the people of Bastone.

The tavern is not a pleasant one, but it is at least warm and dry. It is clear, if you know who to talk to, anything or anyone can be had for a price. Knives stick from a table where players engage in rounds of Charl, placed as a show of faith that the loser will not stab the winner. A lone minstrel with piercing eyes strums a strange three stringed instrument in a corner, eyeing everyone who enters with interest, as if he is waiting for someone. It is plain from the frown on the Herald's face this is not the location you are looking for.

The Grand Bazaar is an exciting crush of people, sounds, sights and smells. Bright tents and shop signs dot the sides of the road as well as the middle of the street. Movement is slow but it gives you time to see the vendors' wares. From simple cuts of meat, to jewelry, to clothing and household wares. Shouting and fights over prices drown out the street musicians and corner preachers, while the smells of a thousand different meals fill the air.

The Old Docks are uneven and hard to traverse, except where heavy carts are pushed and have dug ruts into the paths from the largest of the warehouses. Amber and wood are burned here in vast amounts to provide the city with all its needs. It is busy, dirty and loud. Small bands of men go about, collecting protection money and threatening anyone foolish enough to wander here by accident. Corrupt overseers and lawless gangs make no attempt at hiding themselves.

The Gutters are foul. Human waste runs freely in the street, and thousands of gutterfolk huddle in the deep depression of the river bed. Shacks and huts fill the streets between the looming presence of old trade vessels forever moored in the mud. You hold up an iron piece and start to walk the gutters. The sign is well known. Free Companies often seek information about a hunt, and payment is always the quickest way to an answer. Several of the bolder street urchins jump forward and claim they know who you're looking for, but a few pointed questions about Jonas prove they are chancers and do not know the boy. You spend several hours this way until a girl named Anya shows promise. She says she knows his mother, and takes you to a small lean-to shack in the shadow of a great ship."</string>
    <string name="chp5b_17_1__c">You go in and start to question the woman. She seems very suspicious of you, and as the conversation begins, a boy walks in behind her. The woman shouts for the boy to run and he bolts.</string>
    <string name="chp5b_17_2__c">"The boy jumps under a cart full of rotting vegetables and dashes between some tents to lose you. You shove the cart out of the way and give chase. He is small, and knows the terrain. He dodges people and old shipwrecks easily, bounding from an old lifeboat he grabs a piece of worn sail and attempts to climb it. You catch up, tug the sail and he tumbles down.

\"I didn't want to leave him, but the bug came and I had no sword!\" he protests dejectedly. \"Rhiner already cut me loose. I needed that iron for food. What more does he want?\"

After you calm him down and explain you are not here about his desertion, you offer him the iron in exchange for information about the lost company.

\"No, I won't take charity. I'm earning my way. You hire me on, and I'll squire for you.\"

You are about to remind him only knights have squires but there is a fervor in his eyes. You realize he needs this, and without the information you will be going into the Deepwood blind."</string>

    <string name="chp5b_1_1__a">"Location 1 – The Deepwood

The boy leads you to the spot where the people died. As expected there are no bodies and no blood left. However, there is damage, and a lot can be learned here. Plenty of low branches are broken, and there is evidence of death and destruction in a wide area around. The beast moved incredibly quickly, that much is clear. You can see the last stand of the Free Company as they stood back to back against some assailant, though whatever it was never touched the ground. Something with wings did this."</string>

    <string name="chp5b_26_1__c">"You walk the clean streets of the noble quarter on the opposite side of the bridge. Although still overpopulated, these are less crowded streets than you are used to in Old Town. People here nod slightly with closed eyes when they see your marks. Several bow. The buildings are remarkably well kept. No cracks travel the walls, no broken windows. The faces are less gaunt, and a range of colors fill your view instead of the wash of brown you would expect on the northern side of the river.

Eventually you reach a dark metal gate, and upon bearing your marks you gain admittance, passing through a spacious courtyard into a central hall with a large granite table. Several men gather around the table chattering in concern. They look up as you enter.

\"Lord Rhiner,\" a guard announces, \"The Free Company.\"

A heavyset Lord Rhiner smiles. \"Good, good, the Heroes of Bastone. Come, we were just discussing the expedition. As you know a few days ago one of my work crews was slain in the Deepwood. Not one logger came back alive. This was an awful blow, the city needed that wood. I am one of the few with writ to log the Deepwood, and have been charged with a sacred task to see the city does not lose its supply. I must send another group tomorrow to prove to the king that the supply is open.\" Lord Rhiner straightens up from the table. \"I need you to protect this run. One day, in and out and the rate is fair. Will you accept the contract?\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp5b_26_2__a">"\"Amber burns,\" Rhiner explains, \"but wood burns hotter, longer. It's the cornerstone of our industry, our buildings, our repairs.

The supply must be opened again.\""</string>
    <string name="chp5b_26_3__a">"You sign the contracts as you ask the Lord for more information. Dusting the parchment, you blow off the excess dust and slide the scroll into a tube at your waist.

\"The last group out was nearly forty strong,\" Lord Rhiner says. \"Protected by a Free Company and a King's Knight. All that came back was the Knight's squire, a boy named Jonas, and a one-handed woman, a cur called Keet. The boy was… terrified. He could tell me nothing, so I sent him off. Keet, as curs do, simply vanished.\"

You express that you need to talk to these witnesses and Lord Rhiner looks slightly embarrassed.

\"This city is a big place but I expect finding a woman with a wooden hand should not be so hard for you. I don't know about the boy. You are to set out tomorrow at daybreak from the King's Gate. Do not be late.\""</string>

    <string name="chp5b_31_1__a">"The Departure

At the side of the path leading through the King's Gate, a company of loggers is unhappily assembled and waiting. The foreman steps forward and greets you.

\"How are your men?\" you ask.

\"They'll do their job,\" the large man mutters through a rough red beard. \"They got their axes, and those that could afford 'em brought extra knives. These men can hit a tree, but God only knows if they can hit a beast. Guess that's what you're here for.\" You nod slightly, and take position at the head of the column."</string>
    <string name="chp5b_31_1__c">"Once the massive gates yawn open, the troop follows you out to the treeline. Even though there are fresh stumps here from prior expeditions, new trees and vines are already regrowing in the area. It seems like there will never be a lumber shortage, as it grows back faster than the teams can harvest it.

You trudge into the underbrush toward more ancient growths of massive trees with trunks two men would struggle to reach their arms around. You motion for the group to stop, and the foreman hurriedly assigns splinter groups to work on specific trees. The men work quickly, and not long after the first tree falls, that's when it hits you."</string>

Wings flash in the light as the bulbous grotesquery of the Bloatfly dives and forces a long stinger into the soft stomach of one of the loggers. His body begins to swell and distort as he writhes in agony, lifted from the ground as the Bloatfly hovers on massive translucent wings. The insectile head flits to your free company and you see… nothing… nothing at all in those cold, faceted eyes. Not waiting to find out what happens next, you charge.</string>

The King's Gate creaks and pops as huge counterweights pull massive chains. The iron bull atop the wall glares towards the Deepwood as a regiment of over a dozen blue cloaked guards return from an expedition. There are few reasons for guards to go beyond the wall, but from their equipment you guess these had to go out to shore up some of the stakes and traps at the wall's base. They had run afoul of something, as several are bloodied. Upon entering, the regiment is met by a small group of priests that draw pulses and bandages from satchels to tend to their wounds.

Guards on the gate look at you nervously, wondering why a Free Company has come to them. They eye each other and shift uneasily as you approach, fearing what news or charge you bring.

Two A'Dendri drop from a vine road overhead and land soundlessly in front of you. One pounds out a rapid series of taps and scratches on its hand and forearm before leaning forward inquiringly. It pulls its hood tight around its oddly floral face and waits.

You step forward, and awkwardly clap your wrists a few times. The A'Dendri bounces slightly, perhaps chuckling. The traders' language known as The Knock, is difficult to master, and you only ever gained a passing acquaintance with it. The A'Dendri seem to get the idea though.

Their answer to your question is a simple hand gesture. \"Yes.\" Someone has been here with a hand made from a tree, something they seem to find most amusing, as if she were trying to be like them.

You attempt to ask, \"Where?\" and the A'Dendri tap out a response.

The herbalist stands amid a bed of herbs, nursed by light rays streaming in from several large holes in the roof, as if the roof had been an inconvenience. The edges of her foliage seem freshly faded, almost a tone of autumn, telling you she is fairly old. She holds up a hand, warning you not to get too close.

\"They are not used to so many humans at once,\" Greycane says, \"When they do see humans they are usually either collecting taxes or gangs causing troubles for the barkskins.\""</string>

    <string name="chp5b_9_1__a">"Location 9 – Tavern

The tavern is not a pleasant one, but it is at least warm and dry. It is clear, if you know who to talk to, anything or anyone can be had for a price. Knives stick from a table where players engage in rounds of Charl, placed as a show of faith that the loser will not stab the winner. You approach the bartender. When you mention the woman with the wooden hand, he thinks for a moment, eyes your marks, and nods to the far end of the room.

A lone minstrel with piercing eyes strums a strange three stringed instrument in a corner, playing in particular to a blonde woman sipping a warm drink before him. As you head over, the minstrel eyes you and the woman turns. She sighs."</string>
    <string name="chp5b_9_2__a">"The minstrel eyes you up and down and notes the Oathmark. Apparently he is satisfied. He wanders over, gently strumming.

\"I am Clint. You…\" the minstrel says to your Cur in a soft unrecognizable accent, \"And only you.\"

Clint positions himself leaning against a wall and plays absentmindedly.

\"My Lotus,\" he says, as she looks up at him from her drink. \"A kindred spirit from a Free Company.\""</string>
    <string name="chp5b_9_3__c">"She looks wary, but lowers her drink, and with her wooden hand indicates to take a seat at her table.

\"You're here about the logging expedition,\" she starts before you can even speak. \"It went sideways. Fast. Bad. We hit the edge of the Deepwood. There was this buzzing. This wasn't some swarm of mosquitoes though. There was screaming. Dying. It was huge. Wings. A stinger going through men like a knife through tender mushroom. The men… they burst. I tried to get behind, it lurched and I went down. That's it. I guess it threw me clear with its tail. When I woke up, nothing was left. Lots of bodies. Mostly… burst open. I've been on better contracts. We weren't ready. Grabbed a compass off the dead and made it back.\""</string>

\"Yet she drinks with you,\" you point out.

He smiles. \"That she does. I am the exception.\"

\"Just a few words?\" you ask gently.

You peer past him and see that she is manipulating the fingers on her wooden hand into various offensive gestures.

\"Her lips part for no one,\" the minstrel explains slowly. Then with a sly smirk. \"Again, I am the exception.\"

Keet inhales sharply and turns, over her shoulder, \"Clint, shut your mouth. Play them a song. Show them the exit.\"

\"Yes, Lotus,\" the minstrel smiles. He plays a familiar song as he stays between you and the woman. When he finishes, he is not angry or threatening, but simply extends an open hand toward the door.

You could make her talk, if you could get your hands on her, but it could be risky. This is obviously her pub and who knows how many of the patrons carry weapons. Without that information though, you will be going into the Deepwood blind.

The sights and sounds of Verum are soon consumed by the path behind you. The distance impossible to tell as each tree merges into the next and a familiar gloom settles over The Wire Road. You have been here many times in the dark, you begin to relax into the long journey ahead."</string>
    <string name="chp6_10_2__c">"You snap to attention as you realize your carelessness. You cannot afford to relax into the march, familiarity will kill you out here. Keeping your eyes on the trees and a hand on the wire you press on.

You are not far from Verum when a pregnant silence falls over the Company. Suddenly, all you can hear is the sound of boots on mud and hands running along the wire. Silence is never good. You draw weapons. There is something out there. 

You catch a glint from predatory eyes, fixed on you. The eyes are moving fast, coming right at you. Horrific two legged things bound through the shadows, almost silent as they come. Seven feet tall with whip like arms, their bodies ruined and twisted by God only knows, they fall on the group. They are so swift…you have no time to shout a warning."</string>
    <string name="chp6_10_3__a">"Something is wrong.

    <string name="chp6_14_1__a">"Location 14 – The Bridge

Under gentle rainfall you make your way to the bridges separating the city. A throng of people going about their business press in on all sides. Even in this mass though, you are given room. The armor on your chest and the iron on your back glean a fearful distance from many. Some of the faces passing by are covered in kerchiefs and rags, trying to protect themselves from the rot people speak of coming out of The Cobbles. It seems the sickness is spreading fast to strong and weak alike, not like a Bloatfly pox at all. It seems the giant fly had not been the cause of this outbreak but only taking advantage of the rancid remains the true source had left behind. Something else plagues the people of The Cobbles.

\"Judgement!\" A man in a hooded cloak yells as you approach the bridge to the noble quarter.

\"The rot is our birthright,\" another shouts, his face covered in runes he has carved into his own flesh, some still as fresh as the blood on his knife. \"Only the righteous can overcome the flesh!\"

In front of the various Doomsayers, a man stands, arms outstretched as if orchestrating the mob. The man looks over his shoulder, he smiles grimly at you.

Samil."</string>
    <string name="chp6_14_2__a">"Behind Samil, at the back of the group of prophets, you see a face racked in terror. The man is staring at Samil. Samil glances at the man, and a growing pool of urine appears at the man's feet. The madman screams and runs into the crowd. A smell of sulphur and decay as Samil carries on smiling. You blink, and he is gone. You cast your eyes into the crowd, but your attention is immediately drawn away by the frantic face of a priest running toward you."</string>

    <string name="chp6_14_4__a">"The crowd is becoming more enthralled by the chorus of Doomsayers. Several voices soon lend their strength, repeating absurd prophecies. \"Oathsworn!\" A priest clad in simple robes, rushes to your side, frantically trying to gain your attention. \"You are Oathsworn, yes? Please, come with me.\"

The priest looks surprised when you don't move. \"Please!\" The priest pleads with you in a whispered growl, trying to avoid unwanted attention from others in the crowd, \"The fate of the city is at stake.\"

\"As you know, the plague has ravaged The Cobbles and it has been quarantined. A short time ago, someone broke the quarantine and ran into the city. If we do not track him down immediately, the whole city could be infected within hours. Please, I beg of you.\""</string>
    <string name="chp6_14_5__a">"\"Hurry. Please.\" The priest implores you as he leads your Company in the direction of The Cobbles. You ask him to explain what happened.

\"My fellow Brothers and I were handing out food at the border of the Cobbles. At some point, one of the Brothers, Marus, left the line. I did not see where he had gone, but moments later he ran straight past us like a man possessed. The look on his face was bitterness itself. Pure anger. I managed to catch a glimpse of his hands as he fled. They were covered in the black lesions of the plague. When he reached the barricade, the guards let him through, unaware he was infected.\"

\"He should not have run. He knows this plague is transmitted through contact. Running through the crowded streets endangers the entire city. There is no telling where he went. Marus is…strange, keeps to himself. We've seen him fiddling with some kind of experiment these last few weeks. Salves and such. But he refuses to speak of them.\"

The man is visibly shaken, \"God. If we don't stop him, he could infect the entire city.\""</string>
    <string name="chp6_14_6__a">"You deny the priest's request, and fear crosses his face as he rushes on to find another who will help him. Now is not the time for heroics, you do not underestimate how dangerous a King's ire could be, nor do you want to keep him waiting."</string>
    <string name="chp6_3_1__a">"Location 3 – The King's Gate

Weapons oiled and armor adjusted, you stand before the great city gates. Bram rummages through your packs, performing one last check on your rations. You would pack them yourself, but you have learned allowing others to do some things for you allows them to feel a part of what you do.

Greycane approaches with a smile on his face, \"Long road ahead. Thought you might like some company. I found a few hired swords you might want to consider taking with you. They aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for in these matters. Brevik recently lost his family to the plague, and needs to work out a few things on the wire. Yani is a trapper, and a damn good one too. Doubtless keep you better fed than Bram,\" he says with a smiling glance at the barkeep. Bram starts a comeback, huffs and then gives up, busying himself with your packs."</string>
    <string name="chp6_3_1__c">"Greycane, never one for a lack of words, gives you one last piece of advice, \"Watch yourself out there, there has been word of strange sightings from the guards. Things in the woods, and not the usual fair. Shadows and bumps in the night. Nothing solid, but you and I both know that's the stuff you need to pay attention to.\"

Finally ready, the mighty gates of the city rumble open, and the road stretches to the dark maw of The Deepwood. The flag of Verum flutters from atop the first stake of The Wire Road. You set your jaw and start walking."</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_1__a">"Location 7 – The Broken Oak

The woods close in around you as you feel the first tremors deep inside you. You thought you'd purged the eggs but you were wrong. Your skin ripples, the Bloatfly maggots burrowing up from beneath…

You shudder, the shadow of night terrors chasing you awake. With the feeling of things boring out from your chest still fresh in your mind, you brace yourselves for the real world and head down to the tap room of The Broken Oak."</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_2__a">"Guard Harlbeck of Bastone approaches you, frustration on his face as you settle down to your mushroom porridge and hard biscuit breakfast.

\"Never thought I'd see the day they turn away a sword arm because of a little gray. I was killing things that would turn their hair white before those pups were even born but they won't have me,\" the old guard says as he sits down stiffly. You raise an eyebrow implying 'who?' \"The Watch, I've been trying to find a Captain who sees sense but there's less than half a pair between 'um,\" Harlbeck says gruffly. You look over the old wardog, the scars on his face, a tapestry of old glories and times he had survived what so many others had not. You can see he needs a purpose and you could use an armsman, someone to keep the peace and tend the armory. However, since the fall of Bastone he has taken hard to the drink, and a lifetime of reacting with violence may be more of a liability than a help.

    <string name="chp6_7_3__a">"A knock comes from the tavern door \"Don't we have people for this?\" Greycane chides as he wipes his hands and goes to answer. He looks over to you as he crosses the room. \"Next time you choose to bring another stray back, can you pick one who looks like they know how to turn a handle.\"

You cannot see who is at the door but after a brief exchange Greycane turns back into the room, a scroll in hand. Breaking the seal and unraveling it, Greycane reads and looks up with a smile, \"Best get your boots on, you have an appointment with the King.\""</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_4__a">"\"I must share something with you,\" she says under her breath looking up at you. \"It is indecent conversation, but I must tell you. You see, I was born here in Verum, and lived here until my parents died. My uncle, a foul man, took control of our estate and would have killed me to secure it. He would have succeeded, if not for good friends who spirited me away to Bastone with nothing but a locket.\" She motions to the small locket nestled below her neckline. \"I had been a ward there ever since. My home, however, is here. I need those who know, knew…my family to speak on my behalf, to help me restore my rightful position and retrieve my estate. I also would not be averse to seeing my uncle exiled to the Deepwood without a knife, but that may come later. For now will you help me?\" She moves forward putting a hand on one of your arms. \"Will you help me reach the court?\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_5__a">"She smiles gleefully clasping her hands together.

\"I'm going to court…I must get ready.\"

She practically twirls, as her feet patter quickly upstairs.

\"Well she's very forthcoming when she wants something,\" Bram says suspiciously, drying a mug with a cloth. \"Isn't she just?\" says Greycane with a grin, as he watches the woman's ascent of the stairs. 

The table is cleared and you are ready to move on, but Elanna has still not returned. \"The King waits on no one you know,\" Bram says after a time. You get up, about to leave when Elanna appears, a long flowing pearlescent gown clinging to her as she heads down the stairs. Where she obtained such finery is a question for another time, and one few care to ask as they watch her. 

Greycane steps forward, lifts her hand and kisses it with a flourish. \"Perhaps for this he would not mind waiting,\" he smiles."</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_6__a">"\"You do not understand!\" she snaps, fire in her eyes. She then takes a deep breath and fingers an elaborate necklace charm. She looks at each of you and her expression softens. She curtly nods, a poor imitation of an apology, smiling tight lipped. She spins on her heels and marches sternly upstairs to the room you have provided her.

\"She,\" Greycane says, \"Scares me. And I'm not afraid to say it. If you made me choose between fighting a tribesman armed to the teeth and her armed with that stare, I'd take on the savage every time.\"

He grabs his instrument, slings it over his shoulder, and heads into the street as you follow."</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_8__a">"The man looks up, a new light in his eye. \"It's more than I could have hoped. I'll not let you down.\""</string>
    <string name="chp6_7_9__a">"\"I heard what Greycane said, are you really going to see the King?\" Lady Elanna says coming up beside you, her body close enough for you to smell her scent. After the Deepwood you gave lodging to this mysterious woman, a ward from a dead house, now without position or possessions, yet still clad in the surety and confidence born of nobility. You are not sure if it is her bearing or her beauty, but she always left others feeling like they should have done more to please her. You nod to her question, \"I know this is asking a lot,\" she says sweetly, \"But I would love to go with you to court. It's very important.\"

The blood you wipe from your blades is dark and syrupy, it has the sweetly sick smell of rotten meat. Twisted corpses of unholy bodies still twitch as blood bubbles from them. You have spent more time in the Deepwood than most dare dream, so what are these things that you have never seen or heard of? Perhaps the Order of Dragons in Cistercia will have some record of them. One thing you do know is these woods are scattered with the bodies of men who did not know enough.

You sheathe your weapons. The Wire Road offers little to console you as you head on to Cistercia. At least there is no chance of you relaxing now."</string>

    <string name="chp6a_28_1__a">"Location 28 – Verum Palace

You see the imposing sight of Verum Palace long before you reach its gates. Its vaulted towers reach high into the sky, its walls bulge with great fortification. 

Upon entering the palace proper you are ushered through echoing halls and stone corridors until you finally pass through the great carved doors of the throne room. 

The throne room itself is immense. Dazzling stained glass covers the rear wall, diffusing the room in a spectrum of color. Nobles mill in loose organization around the columns, hundreds of them, still they make no impression of filling the grand space. Your eyes travel up the broad, red woven carpet to the throne that sits under the stained glass.

King Favian is young. You would guess not much older than Midge. His hair is bright, as are his eyes under a simple crown. He sits, straight backed and forward. It is clear he is observing the discussions and positions of every noble and counselor in the room. Guards, at attention, line the walls and at the back of the room, standing alone, are two unmoving Watchers cloaked in midnight black. 

An advisor notes your entrance and as if they had been waiting for you a chime rings out. The nobles turn to the throne, and a loud voice calls out across the crowd, \"Lord Bruer, The Crown will hear your petition for judgement.\" A middle-aged man steps from the crowd and bows.

\"Highness. I seek justice. Lord Tavender has committed a wrong that must be righted. He has taken the hand of my daughter, Markena, and a large holding as dowry. No small price, I assure you. He insults my house and myself by refusing to consummate the marriage by the third night as is law.\"

The noble indicates his daughter, standing behind him in the crowd. She is perhaps nineteen, her sullen face downcast as she stands dutifully next to her new husband. A simply dressed man in his fifties, tall and thin with signs of his age creeping into his features. 

\"Indeed, Lord Bruer,\" the advisor replies, \"Accusations of this nature are taken most seriously by the throne. Has the woman been tested?\"

\"We can attest to her maidenhood, she has not been touched by a man,\" says an older woman from a group of midwives.

\"Lord Tavender. What is your response to the accusations laid against you?\" the advisor says.

Tavender bows and steps meekly forward, \"Highness. My intentions toward Lady Markena are nothing but honorable. She has security in my home and I love her as my own blood. I have known her since she was a girl. We are happy, but I…I cannot bring myself to the deed.\"

The King's advisor takes a breath to continue, when the King raises his hand to stop him. He turns to you.

\"Free Company,\" he announces, his voice confident and firm beyond what his years would suggest.

You step to the carpet before the King, and kneel.

\"Tell me how you would judge this? You are my weapons and I would see just how sharp you are, show me your keen edge in this.\"

\"Why, neighborliness, sire,\" Bruer says with a broad smile.

\"Ah, of course, neighbors you are…in the Underways. The labyrinths are confusing. It must be difficult to know what is yours and what is another's down there. In MY underways,\" reminds the King. Bruer's smile fades as he gently wipes his temples as the young King continues. 

\"You know the story of my father's victory over the Underway ganglords, do you not, Lord Bruer? Fifteen-thousand good men died to rid the city of that filth. He never got them all though. Some disappeared deeper into the tunnels. Others, some say, came above ground like rats to feed off the city. Yours is a young house is it not? Yet gaining such wealth so quickly makes it easy to overstep your bounds. You look uncomfortable, my Lord. Tell me, would you freely submit to a search of your tunnels and caves?\"

\"Certainly, sire,\" Bruer retorts. \"Of course, I shall… send word to prepare for your inspectors.\"

He bows and walks backward, but the King nods and two guards step to block his retreat. \"That won't be necessary. They were there this morning.\" Bruer's face goes white. \"And returned with word of a cave filled with carts formerly belonging to Lord Tavender.\"

Tavender stares firmly at Bruer, whose eyes go wide as he sweats before the King.

Before he can speak, the King silences him with a raised hand. \"You are the son of Ganglord Torvar… yes, I know,\" he says as Bruer looks down. \"If you knew of Tavender's illness, through union, you would control two seventh parts of the Underway when the poor man passes. You would have controlled our supply lines and seen the ganglords returned to the depths. This, I will not allow,\" his tone dead serious. \"May I finish what my father started. Lord Inquisitor…\"

At the King's gesture, an aged man with a hooked nose, his belt jangling with keys and cruel looking instruments, steps forward from the shadows.

\"Find out what he knows of the 'Remnant' in the Underways. I have a regiment of guards who need testing.\"

The Inquisitor nods as guards grab Bruer and drag him screaming from the hall. A palpable fear descends on the nobility. \"Lord Tavender,\" the King says, \"By the law of the land I declare your marriage annulled… however the dowry given to you, being of your own property, is yours. Lady Markena, your father will be executed for treason and your house dissolved. I see one course of action for you. Lord Tavender, I understand you have no children.\" The Lord nods. \"Will you take this woman into your home as your daughter?\"

\"I will, sire,\" pronounces Lord Tavender.

\"So be it,\" declares the King. Lady Markena smiles at Lord Tavender.

You look up at the young King on the throne, his regal bearing and countenance belying his years. He has had more than one victory here today. Fear and respect are a powerful combination for a ruler to wield."</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_28b__a">In the crowd you spot Elanna, arms linked with a distinguished looking nobleman. They are pointing to the vaulted ceiling, seemingly talking about the architecture of the great hall, as chatter about the trial begins among the rest of the nobles. Her goal of making connections is apparently going well.</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_29__a">"The King calls for the hall to be cleared, but bids you stay. The court empties, and once the King is satisfied that only you and the small council remain, he leans forward. \"Now to other matters. There is a plague ravaging the city. More than Lungrot it seems. High Captain Trent, would you present your findings?\"

A grim-faced Trent steps forward and reports on the casualties and the spread, detailing piles of bodies being found in alleys, the symptoms, and the many losses. \"It is in The Cobbles at the moment, striking old and young, strong and weak alike. To those it touches it is a death sentence.\"

The King nods, \"Your recommendation?\"

The high captain tugs at his elaborate chainmail tunic, \"Your highness. I see no way to contain it. We do not know how it spreads, and to learn these things could take months and many more lives. I suggest the whole of The Cobbles be eradicated by flame. Burn the blocks to the ground, and the plague along with it. Wait for the spring and rebuild.\"

A man wearing ornate robes only allocated to the Chief Apothecary intercedes, \"With due respect to the High Captain, that is madness, sire. May I speak freely?\"

The King nods, \"I'd not have my advisors do anything else.\" 

\"Heal them, sire,\" the Apothecary pleads, \"Not burn them. My people will continue to search for a cure. But the Captain speaks the truth. It is spreading too quickly and getting worse. It pains me to say this, but we need help. The Mendicants of Cistercia are renowned for their knowledge of disease. Send for them and find a cure.\"

With that, a man with an oddly patterned golden robe steps forward.

\"Lord of Coin,\" the King acknowledges, gesturing for the man to speak.

\"A burning would be a massive drain on the royal coffers, sire. Replacing an entire section, just in stone and wood alone, would be a terrible cost. While we see no path to heal them at this time, cordon The Cobbles off. No entry or exit. Let the plague take its toll and reap their lives. But leave the buildings standing one year. Then repopulate.\"

The King turns to a tall thin man in pure white robes and an elaborate mitre hat, \"Archbishop?\"

\"Milord,\" the man says, his voice barely above a whisper. \"God's trials come in many forms. What kills the body may save the soul, and in the heat of the crucible we are remade. The Pillar and The Path. If the pillar cannot stand, it is not fit but if it can be restored, it will be stronger for the trial. Strength may come from this weakness, let us simply wait milord, and see.\"

\"These are all wise words,\" says the King. \"And yet all differ. Free Company, what council would you give?\"

    <string name="chp6a_28_2a__c">"\"As you wish, sire,\" you say as you incline your heads in assent.

You know better than to refuse the King.

The eyes of all the gathered nobles settle curiously on you."</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_2b__c">"About to say you have no authority in these matters, the King sharply raises a hand to interrupt you.

\"I give authority and take it away. Let me see if you are worthy of that which has been given to you already.\"

The eyes of all the gathered nobles settle curiously on you."</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_30__c">\"You are harsh, but these are harsh times,\" the King replies, \"The strength of this city is built on sacrifice. Perhaps you are right. To kill a handful, we may save many more. The decision is regrettable, but perhaps necessary.\"</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_31__c">\"There is danger in that path, especially for you. Hopeful, but perhaps foolhardy. What if there is no cure or the Mendicants do not have the craft to find it? What would happen to the city then? Hope is often a treacherous ally.\"</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_32__c">The King shrugs slightly, \"A half measure, though perhaps the wisest choice. The area is contained at the moment, but there is no promise it will stay that way. If the plaguebearers riot or bribe the guards, then what? We will be back here once more. But, then thinking of half the city, not just a few streets… It is risky but not without reward.\"</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_33__c">"\"If this be God's will I would see it done, but has a sign been given, Archbishop?\" The Archbishop looks to the King, to the Watcher behind him, and back at the King.

\"This is your servant's opinion only, sire,\" the Archbishop confesses."</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_34__a">"The Watcher glides forward and whispers in the King's ear before he can make any proclamation agreeing or disagreeing with your decision. He listens. The King nods, resigned.

\"Your council has been weighed by the throne,\" the King declares. \"Free Company, be my voice. Travel to Cistercia. Take my seal, and under my authority, return with what Mendicants are released to your charge. High Captain, open the armory doors to this Company that they might steel themselves for the journey. Archbishop, set a vigil for them, they carry our hopes into the Deepwood.\" The King gives his leave and you bow, wondering at the irony of the term 'Free Company' in times like this.

    <string name="chp6a_28_3a__a">You ask the advisor to review the accusations. The Lord Tavender has married Lady Markena, daughter of Lord Bruer. Lord Bruer has proven the marriage has not been consummated, against the law of the land which clearly states that such a dishonor must be satisfied.</string>
    <string name="chp6a_28_4__a">"You question the simply dressed Lord, asking of the situation surrounding his marriage to the much younger woman. \"For generations my family has been honored by possessing writ to work a one seventh part of the Underways here in the city. I did not wish marriage but during the last few years things have become difficult. Carts have frequently gone missing, and my work gangs attacked as they descend the tunnels. We thought it beasts but the apothecaries assured us they had been attacked by man made weapons. The workers spoke of the 'Remnant' and the old ganglords rising up again. I was desperate, and then Lord Bruer came with an offer of guards and fresh carts in dowry for the hand of his daughter.\" Lord Tavender stifles a chesty cough as he looks to Lady Markena. \"I knew her from court. She had played in my gardens as a girl, and I knew there was little happiness for her under her father's roof. So I thought it a kindness to bring her under my own. She is well cared for, and she has brought life back into my old halls since my previous wife died three winters ago.\"

\"A large sum was paid in dowry for my only daughter to my Lord Tavender,\" spits Bruer, \"It appears he believes he can squander it, annul the marriage, and marry again to take another's iron.\" 

You know this man, his type, a bully. Sensing something you step a little closer to Lord Bruer. He backs away instinctively. You thought as much.

You stride between the pillars of the grand church, where a young befuddled priest greets you.

\"Yes, I believe it was brother Marus who rushed in here,\" he says, shying away from your weapons. \"He wanted to know where our Chief Apothecary, Corbus, was. I told him he was not in his laboratory and that he had been called south of the river. Corbus must be on a journey of some importance, as his aids took many packages and boxes with him.

A dagger slams into the dying man's eye, ending him before he can finish. The woman retrieves the knife from the man's skull, wiping the blood off on her leather pant leg. \"Thank you for keeping your oath. My brother would have done the same for any of you.\" She nods in respect as she leaves.

Splintered wood creaks as you walk along the once waterlogged old docks that jut out over the dried up river bed. Wary eyes peer from behind stacked crates that double as homes.

You hear angry shouts as a woman bursts from behind an old shack, her face bloodied and bruised. She notices your group as she runs and cries out, \"Help!\"

A trio of scruffy men give chase, soon catching up and tackling her hard onto the wooden dock. The collapse of bodies is enough for the woman to wriggle free.

\"She's a murderer and thief. Slit Tomin's throat and stole a family heirloom from him,\" explains one with an old, ugly scar running from his left eyebrow down to his chin.

\"My family heirloom, you scum!\" she rages, causing you to reinforce your grip on her.

None alive today have ever seen a large body of water, let alone know what it means to travel upon it.

Descending into the muddy expanse filled with ramshackle hovels and lean-tos you start to question those that live in the shadow of the city above.

Stinking he was, thought I'd be sick…then he got up an' ran off without a by your leave,\" she explains.

At its base are two hulking forms you know to be the citadel's guardians, Iron Golems. Half again the size of a man, orange flames glow where their eyes ought to be. You know not to doubt the awareness of those eyes as they follow your every move. No priest could make it past these grim sentries.

Looking around it quickly becomes clear something is wrong. Several archivists are gathered, shouting and gesturing at a pair of city guards attempting to keep them calm.

One of the archivists pulls on his oiled beard, frightened but eager to tell his tale. \"He ran straight to the plans of the city in the civics section. Twenty other patrons must have run out from his screaming and coughing. He had a censer, and there was smoke. I hesitate to think what damage that has done to our collections! He took something with him. You're not allowed to take anything out of the archives. He can't have gotten far, he can barely walk straight.\"

It would be good to know what he took, taking charge of the scene you attempt to do just that."</string>

    <string name="chp6b_27_10__a">"The lightning blasts into the hulking priest, disintegrating him and all the nobles around him in a loud thunderclap. The other nobles gasp in shock, the blast's echo rolling over the room in a wave. You look up from the ruination to the cloaked form of the Watcher, who silently returns to its vigil behind the throne. Looking back, at first, you thought nothing remained of the priest and nobles, but as their ashes begin to fall you see some settle on the untouched form of the censer. 

A man, obviously the Chief Apothecary by his robes, cautiously approaches the remnants. \"I saw his face. God help me, was this…brother Marus?\" he asks you.

An affirmative nod is all he needs. Motioning to the censer, you inform Corbus of Marus's final words.

Corbus stares at you in shock and begins to clear the area. He directs his assistants to carefully maneuver the censer and all Marus's belongings into a small metal trunk without touching them.

\"Explain this immediately!\" the boy King demands with a deep roar that belies his age. Corbus shrinks in supplication and proceeds to explain the events as best he can surmise. Most importantly, Marus's discovery of the plague."</string>
    <string name="chp6b_27_11__a">"Calculating, the King takes it all in. His brows furrowed with lines at odds with such a young face.

\"You claim this censer is the source of the plague then? It has been made?\" the King asks.

\"Yes, my Lord,\" Corbus explains. \"It is spread through touch so it won't harm anyone as long as it remains sealed. But there is something else, which your grace should be aware of. This is not like any other plague we have seen. The infection…changed Marus. Corbus shudders at the recollection.\"

As the King is about to speak, another Watcher, wrapped in an ever-writhing cloak, emerges from the shadows and whispers into the King's ear. The guards step back. The King looks troubled, then nods reluctantly.

\"Your council has been weighed by the throne,\" the King declares. \"I'm afraid we must seek help from our brothers to the north if we are going to defeat this plague.\"

\"Free Company,\" he says, turning his attention to you. \"You hunted this man and uncovered the mystery?\" You incline your heads, knowing what's coming. \"Be my voice. Travel to Cistercia. Take my seal, and under my authority, return with what Mendicants are released to your charge. High Captain, open the armory doors to this Company that they might steel themselves for the journey ahead. Archbishop, set a vigil for them, they carry our hopes into the Deepwood.\"

The boy King rises from his throne and begins his exit, closely followed by the mysterious pair of Watchers. Just before he steps through the antechamber door he glances back over his shoulder.

\"I hear you are called the Heroes of Bastone. I hope you will be known as the Heroes of Verum as well,\" he says with equal parts hope and doubt in his voice. You bow as the King turns away, and you wonder at the irony of the term 'Free Company' in times like this."</string>

Going up the aisles of the cathedral, it is no surprise that priests are everywhere you turn. You ask members of the congregation if they have seen anything suspicious or unusual. Finally, a young man confirms, \"One priest did run into the catacombs. I remember because he kept himself all covered up, like he was hiding something.\"

The door leads to a hallway of arches and intersecting torchlit tunnels inside the catacombs. The priest must have come down here, but which direction did he take?"</string>

Drawing closer, you see it is the priest, hunched over and confused, attempting to decipher the stolen map. A pale smoke trail rises from the censer in his hand. You begin to approach.

Catching him off guard, he looks up and awkwardly turns toward you. Even in the muted amber glow of your torch, you can see he is ill. One eye appears swollen shut, and an elaborate mosaic of black veins, root-like in their pattern, races over his hands and neck.

The priest begins shaking violently as he starts losing control of himself. The effects of the plague must be accelerating. He pleads with you, \"I thought I had more time, you must help me. Find Chief Apothecary Corbus. The plague…it is nothing like we have ever seen.\"

Interrupted by painful body cramps, his face contorts. He can barely speak, \"If the city is to be saved, what is in this censer must be secured and studied…Ahhh!\" You hear the sound of skin popping as the priest twists and contorts unnaturally.

The censer clatters to the floor as he drops to his knees. When he looks up at you to scream, something slithers out of his mouth. Not his tongue, but a long, black vine like the roots of infected Deepwood trees. An unholy howling is followed by the sound of cracking bone and splitting wood. His limbs snap and twist like vines to support him, as his cloak tears, great thorny protrusions force their way through, completing his transformation.

The twisted arboreal aberration that was brother Marus rises, tattered scraps of flesh cling between jutting branches. With juddering motion, it lumbers toward you."</string>

    <string name="chp6b_27_6__c">"Marus, or what is left of him, lays dead before you. The censer lies, unbroken, in the midst of the mass of root and dead flesh. You know the censer should not be touched, and decide it would be better to track down this Chief Apothecary Corbus.

At the end of the passage a secret door leads to the throne room of the palace where a grand audience is in attendance. Slipping into the gathered mass of nobles, you find this Corbus and explain the situation. Between the mark on your wrist, and the name 'Marus', it seems they worked together, he hurries to your aid.

Back at the body, Corbus begins to approach it, you stop him before he gets too close. Motioning to the censer, you inform him of Marus's last words. 

Corbus stares at you in shock. Then directs his assistants to carefully maneuver the censer and all Marus's belongings into a small metal trunk without touching them before turning his focus to you. \"We must inform the King. Come with me.\""</string>
    <string name="chp6b_27_7__a">"Inside the throne room, a boy no more than fifteen summers sits on the throne. He is dressed in finery and sits with regal poise as a host of nobles and servants is dismissed in light of Corbus's request for a private audience.

\"This better be good, Corbus, there were plans for that gathering.\"

Corbus bows low in supplication, \"It is of grave importance, sire.\" He proceeds to explain the events of the last few hours. Most importantly, Marus's discovery of the plague, and his ultimate demise at the hands of your Free Company."</string>
    <string name="chp6b_27_8__a">"Despite your efforts, the mutating priest crashes through the secret passage door into the throne room. A great host is in attendance before the throne, and the priest, fully lost in his mind, stumbles into the assembled nobles, his censer swinging wildly.

The King's guard rushes to bar the path toward the boy King, and his advisors step back in horror.

As you gain ingress, you see a cloaked form move across the dais behind the throne.

A blinding arc of lightning explodes from the cloaked figure."</string>
    <string name="chp6b_27_9__a">You notice the cloaked figure place a small cork into a tiny flask of liquid and deftly slip it beneath his robes.</string>
    <string name="chp6b_28_1__a">"Location 28 – Verum Palace

The Palace gates are more heavily guarded than usual. You question one of the Palace guardsmen and he informs you that no one is permitted into the Palace at this time, by order of the King.

Clearly there is no possibility of the priest coming this way or getting past the considerable security. You continue your search elsewhere.

    <string name="chp6b_2_1__a">"Location 2 – The Cobbles

Approaching the outskirts of the Cobbles, you hear the angry roars of rioting masses before you see them. Residents have learned that someone broke the quarantine and now they all want out. An exhausted squad of city guardsmen is holding the quarantine line, barely. Their arrows being loosed indiscriminately into the mob in an attempt to slow their advance. You get the sense that the barricade could be breached at any moment.

A Sergeant bellows,. \"Hold the line, men! I said, hold the line!\""</string>
    <string name="chp6b_2_2__c">Sensing imminent disaster, you take up bows yourselves and begin firing into the raging crowd. The sheer volume of arrows fired drives the infected back into The Cobbles, the fear of sharp metal piercing their flesh greater than their fear of plague. The barricade is saved, but you now have even more ground to make up chasing this priest.</string>
    <string name="chp6b_2_3__a">The Sergeant of the city guard bellows commands to his men as you approach. You ask him about the priest who broke the quarantine earlier. He briefly looks at you incredulously, then turns back to the scene before him. You will need to be more persuasive if you hope to get information out of him.</string>
    <string name="chp6b_2_4__a">There is nothing to gain by remaining here. You decide it is more prudent to move on.</string>
    <string name="chp6b_2_5__a">"There's no time for subtlety. You grab the Sergeant firmly by the throat, forcing him to make eye contact. What he sees there is worse than the oncoming mob.

Unable to hold your gaze, he fumbles his words, \"I…I don't know…he couldn't have gone east though. I was in charge of a squad that way and he didn't pass me.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp6b_2_6__a">"The Sergeant, furious at your audacity, squares off with you. \"Perhaps the charging mob of infected citizens has escaped your notice? It won't matter where some priest scurried off to if we can't hold that line!\" Distracted by you, he does not see the object hurtling toward his head. The cobblestone strikes the broadside of his face, felling him heavily at your feet with a thud. You can't get any more out of him.

    <string name="chp6b_4_1__a">"Location 4 – The Green Streets

The hard-packed dirt streets become soft and mossy like plush carpet under your tired feet as you approach a vine covered archway that leads to The Green Streets. Several A'Dendri turn toward your Company as you approach, their demeanor more curiosity than fear."</string>
    <string name="chp6b_4_2__a">"An A'Dendri male approaches. He holds out his hand and taps out a simple set of signs using The Knock. He appears to be asking if you have come to trade. You respond that you are looking for a priest who might have traveled this way. He taps out the response for 'no' and asks if you wish to view some of his wares. With no time to waste, you wave him off and quickly move on.

Your A'Dendri returns and informs you that the priest did not pass this way, and there is something else. The A'Dendri have been tending the afflicted and they sense it is not as simple as a fungal rot, it has an unnatural taint to it. It feels intentional and twisted to them. They fear what this means.

The raw stink of livestock punches up into your nose as you enter the Underways. You hear the tinkle of iron coins and the flat cackle of a burly man laughing as a cursing gambler begs for a chance to win his iron back. Both men notice you.

You ask if the men have seen a priest come this way. The burly man furrows his brow, \"A priest in the Underways, nah nothing holy down here. Lady luck's the one that looks over us, ain't that right?\" the man smirks to his dejected opponent.

    <string name="chp6b_6_1__a">"Location 6 – The Apothecary

You enter the cramped apothecary, a queue of Verum's sick and ailing spills out the door and down the street. In your line of work you get to know apothecaries quite well, and at the sight of you the apothecary, one brother Lax, leaves his patient to attend to you. Wiping a bloody hand on his apron he asks how he can help and you tell him of the priest you are looking for.

\"He came in here all right, not sure what he wanted. Don't think he was looking for healing though. He wouldn't let me examine him. Kept all wrapped up like a ball of twine. Very agitated, refused to speak. Looked around, then just ran off.\""</string>
    <string name="chp7_21_10__a">"You find the villagers gathered together in the square. Most of them seem to be in a trance, slowly swaying on their feet with blank expressions on their faces. 

You move in for a closer look, taking up positions behind stacks of crates, and see a row of cages. Most are empty now, but a few contain villagers huddled together.

Before them, you see the familiar silhouette of a Venerator, he reaches into one of the cages and drags out an old man. \"No! Father!\" a young man screams from within another cage as the Venerator moves toward a massive slab of stone bedecked with candles. 

Corpses litter the ground around the slab, but to your surprise there is little blood. In one of the Venerator's hands is a large tome. You do not know what the knight is capable of. Something malefic is clearly taking place. If you bide your time, you may learn more of what is happening here, but a man is about to die and you still have the element of surprise.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp7_21_11__a">"The Venerator slams the man onto the slab, easily holding him down with one hand. His massive mace rises skyward and crashes down in a sickening thud of cracking bone and splattering of blood. 

The young man who had been screaming falls silent, something chasing any emotion from his face. His eyes glaze over as he calmly walks out of the cage, and joins the group of onlookers, no longer paying attention to his father's remains.

As the dead father bleeds out, you watch the blood pooled around the Venerator slowly begin to flow up the legs of his armor. It spreads over the smooth surfaces like a thin film of oil, finding its way into the joints in between, until the pool on the ground is all but gone."</string>
    <string name="chp7_21_11__c">"The Venerator's breathing hastens as he appears to bathe in a euphoria only he feels. Suddenly, his attention snaps in your direction. You can feel the cold stare behind his ornate plated visor. He raises the book toward you, and with it, the glazed eyes of every villager turn to you as one. Silently, they fling themselves towards you as the Venerator hefts his mace.

You grasp your weapons tight and prepare for a fight to the death."</string>
    <string name="chp7_21_12__a">The Venerator slams the man onto the slab, easily holding him down with one hand. He raises his massive mace skyward. Refusing to stand idly by as more innocent villagers are sacrificed, your group charges the plated giant. Closing on the Venerator, you notice the villagers have begun to move too. At first you thought they were joining your charge, and then it dawns on you. Their glazed eyes are locked on you, and you see no humanity in them. As they begin to claw at you, you realize it is not just the Venerator you have to contend with - you will have to fight all of them.</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_1__a">"Passing down a paved road through the fields, you find yourself flanked by the statues of martyrs. They are not smiling, and neither for that matter is anyone else. There are no sounds of merriment. No laughter or shouts of anger. Just people going about their drudgery in silence. 

As you continue on, an odd sound breaks the quiet, the sound of pain and switches. Drawn to it, you find a crowd gathered around a circular dirt patch where a boy is being thrashed with canes by two men wearing demonic masks. Sensing your interest, the priest explains, \"The boy has been there all night and he is now passing through 'the valley' where temptation can be found. To leave the circle is to give in to temptation. He is marked by his sins so he can remember his faults. To spare the rod, is to spoil the child.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_2__a">"You grab the switch and break it across the demon's face. The man falls over and you extend a hand to the boy. He does not move. You gesture that it's okay, but he refuses, balling his hands into fists.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_4__a">The boy grits his teeth yet cannot help but let out cries of pain as red welts crisscross his back and chest. Such discipline in one so young is admirable. One blow finally splits the skin and a rivulet of blood trickles down his back. It is hard to watch but it is their way, and their faith. With encouragement from the priest, you continue on.</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_5__a">You have no wish to see a child beaten today. There is business to attend to. You pass by without pause.</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_6__a">"You grab the boy by the wrist and pull him from the circle. As his feet break the line he begins to cry and will not look at you. \"You have wronged the child, Oathsworn,\" the priest says, \"He has left the circle and is now a sinner and must start again, lest he be marked for his sins.\" 

You look at the other people, the lowest and the impoverished showing faint marks on their arms and necks from distant brands. You look to the mark on your own wrist. You know the weight of past decisions. With a last glance at the boy, you leave."</string>
    <string name="chp7_24_7__a">\"To leave the circle is to give in to temptation,\" the priest explains. \"Should he leave, he will be punished more severely and marked for his sin so all will know his fault forever.\" With a last glance at the boy, you leave as the switch strikes begin to sound again.</string>
    <string name="chp7_29_1__c">"The final stretch of your journey from Verum is devoid of any further man-eating beasts, let alone creatures with barbed, whip-like arms. Since leaving Verum, a never-ending downpour has hampered your trek. Not once has the rain let up, and you are on your third straight day without sleep. The journey is not made easier by the fact you never had a choice. Oathsworn do not refuse a King, not if Verum is to have any chance of surviving the plague.

Stepping from the shadows of the Deepwood, the rains soon cease and a warm sun breaks through the clouds. Glinting in that sunlight are the massive white marble walls of the holy city, Cistercia. 

Outside the city gate, you spot a pair of imposing warriors, their giant kite shields and shining armor splattered with the blood of a fresh kill. At their feet, a pile of mutilated flesh that was once a giant beast of some kind. You have heard tales of a company of Cistercian knights known as the Order of Thorns that often trains its members in this manner - weathering both the mind and body of a knight beyond the wall, until they are both rock-hard.

As you approach the gate, the knights' spears cross, barring your approach. One of your Company members flashes their Oathmark and the weapons part, allowing you to pass. 

Once your group has cleared the quarantine inspection area, the portcullis opens out onto a marvelous sight. In the expanse of land before you lay farms filled with workers harvesting crops and you realize, for the first time, you are seeing above-ground farming. Beyond the fields of golden grain and freshly planted crops, the tiered city rises, white and resplendent, stretching part way up a great mountain range that runs from one end of the horizon to the other. 

A voice pierces your present distraction. \"Pillar and Path, Oathsworn.\" Dressed in the familiar purple cloak of the Cistercian faith, a Priest stands stoically before you. \"We've been expecting you. The Lord Marshall will see you at once.\""</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_10__a">"Accompanied by Quintus, you return to the great cathedral near the first steps of the Ascent. There you find a train of pilgrims beginning their journey up the massive stairway into the heights of the mountain. Each of them walks in solemn awe of the majestic architecture, past the text carved on the walls and into each step of the stairway beneath them.

\"It looks like rain today, don't you think, Oathsworn?\" a quiet voice murmurs behind you. Turning, you see a man dressed in the white robes of the mendicants. \"Pillar and Path,\" he says, touching a shaky hand to his forehead and releasing it. His gaze lingers fearfully on Quintus, standing just behind you. Leaning in, he speaks in hushed tones. \"May we speak privately? I…we need your help.\""</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_11__a">\"Thank you, Oathsworn. Thank you!\" Finnian exclaims in hushed excitement. \"We must join the other members of my church to explain further. They are currently awaiting our arrival under the aqueducts at the third arch behind the Cathedral. We must take different routes so as not to raise suspicion. I will meet you there.\" With a relieved smile, Finnian hurries off.</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_12__a">"Deciding that it is best to stay on the task at hand, you refuse Finnian's request. He sighs deeply in resignation, \"My apologies for disturbing you.\" Turning away, he departs. 

Rejoining Quintus, you continue the hunt for the missing Venerator. Men of their size are hard to miss. Surely someone will have seen something. Much like hunting a beast in the Deepwood, tracking his movements will be your best chance of finding him."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_13__a">"The area around the shrine has been meticulously cleaned. Upon closer inspection, you notice a droplet of liquid on one of the candles that does not appear to be wax. You dab it with your finger and raise it to your nose. The substance has a strong chemical stink, perhaps some sort of embalming fluid? You question the custodian, but he cannot offer an explanation for its presence and assures you that embalming fluid would not be used in the preservation of the armor.

With nothing more to be gathered here, you decide to move on."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_14__a">"The area around the shrine has been meticulously cleaned. It appears great care was taken to ensure no evidence was left behind. 

With nothing more to be gathered here, you decide to move on."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_15__a">"The greeting used by the mendicant is one you know well. To speak of the coming rain is a secret reference used by your brothers and sisters in the low church to identify one another when in the presence of outsiders. This man, like you, is a follower of The Way. To risk exposure, with the Lord Marshall's adjutant nearby, it must be of dire importance. It is not too difficult to break free of Quintus and find out what the mendicant needs."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_16__a">"There is something odd about the man's greeting, and the obvious fear in his demeanor begs further questioning. It is not too difficult to break free of Quintus and find out what the mendicant needs."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_17__a">"You tell Quintus that you wish to pray before continuing with the investigation, and ask that he wait here while you do so. Mingling with the huge crowd of pilgrims and supplicants, you slip out of sight and find a quiet alcove where you are able to converse with the mendicant. 

\"My name is Finnian,\" he whispers. \"I represent an order of the true faithful who are prepared to help you. We know that you seek mendicants to aid with the plague in Verum and there are many in our numbers. My order is not associated with the High Church or their corrupt doctrine, and we can provide the mendicants you require. All we ask is that you help us free my master who has been unjustly sentenced to death.\" 

You ask him what crime his master stands accused of. 

\"No more than healing a sick child,\" he continues. \"The High Church decreed that all miracles have ceased. Anyone who attempts to perform such an act is said to have committed witchcraft. My master saved a child only to be betrayed by the boy's parents. Now, the boy has been executed and my master is set to be publicly tortured and burned at the stake tomorrow. If you are willing to help us, we pledge to provide all the mendicants you require. Please. He is a good man. Will you help us save him?\""</string>

    <string name="chp7_2_1__a">"Location 2: The Hall of the Hundred

\"It is called the Ascent,\" Quintus tells you as he motions a gloved hand toward the gleaming white cathedral which towers before you. Built directly into the side of the mountain, its elegantly carved stone construction reflects the sunlight, nearly blinding all who look directly upon it. \"The first steps of the great staircase begin here, winding up the inside of the mountain, all the way to the summit itself,\" he continues. \"That is where the most sacred site of our faith lies.\" 

Passing through massive double doors, the sheer size of its vaulted ceiling and the mastery of its stonework take your breath away. You travel along a path which runs directly through the center of the cathedral. Flanking you on either side are twelve great suits of armor perched atop tall marble plinths. Supplicants bow in prayer before each one, giving you the sense they are more like shrines than weapons of war. 

Quintus notices your interest and explains, \"These are the sacred suits of armor worn by the Venerators. Come, this way.\"

He leads you to another area of the cathedral, well away from the throngs of pilgrims and supplications. The air here is filled with the strong scent of weapon oil mixed with incense. On Quintus' authority, you enter the Hall of the Hundred. 

The giant warrior priests known as the Venerators are unmistakable. Towering men of chiseled muscle, each is half again as tall as any human. Each is dressed in richly decorated robes with cowls pulled over their heads - always concealing their faces. Some of the warrior priests train in fenced sparring arenas while others pace the hall, studying huge leather-bound tomes.

Your presence is noted immediately as one of their custodians approaches you. The man, dressed in silver robes with green gems set into the collar, addresses your party. \"I assume you are the adjutant?\" he inquires. Quintus nods and, curiously, ushers the custodian off to the side so they can speak out of your earshot. Another reminder that outsiders are not trusted here.

After a few moments, they seem to reach agreement and the custodian addresses your group, \"Very well then. If you seek to know us, you must first be weighed. By blade or blood, our masters demand a test of combat. One or all must face the trial. Iron sharpens iron. The pillar must be strengthened.\" 

Looking at the giants arrayed before you, you realize this is probably going to hurt. Getting injured on a hunt is a serious matter and not something to be looked for. The Venerators are said to have the strength of ten men, you will put that to test, but how best to proceed? One of you could take the test alone or you could attempt it together and possibly stand a better chance, though the more people taking this trial, the more people could take a beating.

    <string name="chp7_2_3__a">"You are led by the custodian into an adjacent hall with a large stone platform in the center. Beautiful murals depicting ancient battles from times long gone cover each wall and massive marble statues, placed uniformly around the room, stand in silent vigil. 

Moments later, one of the robed giants enters, flanked by his attendants. As the men remove their master's robes, you see scars and religious symbols cover his bare upper body. Handing the Venerator a blunted sword, his attendants then place a new hood over his head, all the while hiding his visage, before finally bowing away in prayer. It seems war and worship are one here. 

As the Venerator climbs the steps to the top of the platform, his stare never leaves you. 

\"To fall is to fail. Stay on the path,\" explains the custodian as he hands each of you a blunted sword, and motions for you to climb the platform."</string>

    <string name="chp7_2_5__a">"The dance of battle begins with you striking out in a dizzying whirl of attacks. The Venerator, unphased by your aggressive attempt, turns the blows aside in a shower of sparks. The fight carries on for several minutes and you realize you do not have the stamina to keep it up much longer. Employing brains rather than brawn, you lure the Venerator in. As he prepares to deliver a finishing blow, you slide to his flank and strike the back of his leg. The Venerator momentarily loses his balance, providing the opportunity you need to knock him over the edge of the platform. The prayers of the attendants instantly cease and the room falls silent.

\"Your pillar is strong indeed, Oathsworn,\" the custodian observes as you descend the platform."</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_6__a">You stand before your adversary atop the platform. As the dance of battle begins, the Venerator strikes you like a bolt of lightning, unleashing a flurry of hammering blows. You grunt as you take a blow to your side, forced to give ground as the larger warrior drives you back to the edge. Sparks fly until your swords lock. You attempt to slow his advance, but are unable to overpower the Venerator as he sends you soaring off the platform, crashing onto the cold stone floor some ten feet away.</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_6__c">The custodian leans over your prone form. \"The trial is over, Oathsworn. You bore yourself well and that is enough for now,\" he says matter of factly.</string>
    <string name="chp7_2_7__a">"You stand on the platform, shoulder to shoulder before your adversary. Like a bolt of lightning, the Venerator attacks and the dance begins.

Walking past each of the relics, you find them richly adorned with candles, scrolls of text and small offerings. The faith drives every Cistercian to perfection and you can see it here. 

Your custodian escort eventually stops beside an empty pillar, which has several lit candles and a stack of heavy tomes sitting atop it in place of the armor. A pair of custodians kneel in prayer before it, unaware of your presence. 

\"Logos, the armor of the Word,\" your custodian escort informs you. \"He has not been seen in three days, nor have his attendants. As you know, this is deeply concerning to us. Our masters are the embodiment of our faith and the loss of even a single one brings shame upon us all. You now bear that shame as well, Oathsworn. Let us pray you are strong enough to carry it.\" 

As the custodian speaks, you inspect the shrine."</string>
    <string name="chp7_6_1__a">"The Conclave is the seat of all authority in Cistercia. The massive building, constructed from huge blocks of white marble, noticeably lacks the pretentiousness of the ornamental spires and intricate patterns found on the cathedrals and religious buildings.

The priest leads you through a criss-cross of hallways, finally arriving at the chamber of the Lord Marshall of Cistercia. A broad-shouldered man with the regal look of a military officer, he is speaking with an aide and signing a document as you enter. \"The price of heresy is fire. Make sure they understand,\" he remarks, returning the quill to the inkwell before dismissing the aide and turning his attention to you. 

\"Ah, the Free Company. The King sent a raven before your arrival, so I'll cut to the heart of it. You have traveled far, Oathsworn. However, the mendicants are indisposed at the moment. You may have them once they return. You have my word. In the meantime, there is a delicate matter which requires your unique capabilities.\"

You turn to see a square-jawed guard, clad in polished steel armor, close the only door to the chamber and take a position at your side. He stands at attention with his gaze fixed straight ahead. Apparently this discussion is not intended for anyone outside of this room.

\"This is a highly delicate matter. Your silence and discretion are not optional,\" insists the Lord Marshall, looking at each of you in turn.

\"One of our most holy warrior priests has gone missing. A Venerator of the Hundred. None have ever failed their charge before and only in death does their duty end. They are a light that guides our faithful and to have one simply go missing is a matter of grave concern. You must find this warrior and return him to us. Should he not be found alive, you will recover his armor and weapons. They are relics of our faith.\"

The Lord Marshall motions to the armored warrior standing beside you. \"Quintus, my adjutant, will assist you. He carries my authority with him and will see that you have everything you need while conducting your… investigation.\" 

Quintus looks every bit the dutiful soldier and no doubt carries the Lord Marshall's eyes and ears wherever he goes as well."</string>
    <string name="chp7_6_9__c">"\"I would suggest you begin at the Hall of the Hundred. Quintus will show you the way,\" utters the Lord Marshall, as he turns his attention once again to documents arranged on the table before him. \"You are dismissed.\"

As you make your way to the door, the Lord Marshall offers one last bit of advice. \"Speak not a word of this to anyone, Oathsworn, or the mendicants will be the least of your concerns.\""</string>
    <string name="chp7_epi_1__a">"The lifeless body of the Venerator lays in a pool of his own blood, which thankfully remains motionless in uneven puddles on the ground. Relieved the magical forces that allowed him to manipulate the blood have departed, you look to the cages and see villagers weeping and consoling one another.

You cannot shake the sense that something is still not right. All the villagers outside of the cages remain enthralled and sway catatonically on their feet. Whatever spell they are under has not been lifted."</string>
    <string name="chp7_epi_3__a">"You find Finnian in an area well away from the carnage, consoling a mother and her two daughters. No doubt the family of Father Pyren. Thankfully, they must have been in the cages, and spared the fate of so many of the others. Despite the terrible news, they appear unharmed. 

Seeing you, Finnian offers you a slight smile that does not reach his eyes. \"The mendicants will be ready to depart as promised, I assure you. Thank you, Oathsworn. I had wished to stay longer with you, but I owe Father Pyren the peace of knowing his family will be looked after. We will travel back to Verum with you, and then I must make sure they are safe. You understand.\" You nod in respect at the responsibility the young man would willingly bare, not all oaths come with a mark."</string>
    <string name="chp7_epi_4__a">"You find Finnian in an area well away from the carnage, consoling a mother and her two young daughters. You assume it must be the family of Father Pyren as they appear overjoyed by the news Finnian shares. Thankfully, they must have been in the cages, and spared the fate of so many of the others. They appear unharmed. Seeing you, Finnian gives you a broad smile. \"The mendicants will be ready to depart as promised, I assure you. As soon as you are ready. Thank you, Oathsworn.\" It wasn't all loss at least."</string>
    <string name="chp7_epi_5__a">"Moving closer to one of those still afflicted, you note they seem to be dormant, as though sleep walking. Further questioning reveals the Venerator arrived at the village yesterday and immediately started rounding up everyone into cages. The sacrifices began soon after. No words were spoken though, it seems whenever he killed a victim, he would gain power over one of their close relatives or loved ones. The thought curls your lips in disgust, those he did not kill he forced you to put down. Now only a handful remain, an entire village decimated.

As if things could not get any worse for the survivors you suddenly hear something no parent wants to hear. \"The Children!\" a woman cries. \"They're gone!\""</string>
    <string name="chp7a_10_1__a">"Location 10 - Banksmith

The Banksmith here is inside the inner city walls, and it is a large workshop filled with apprentices hammering away at metal around a central furnace. Asking after the Venerator, you learn that they have their own forges and so have no need to visit a lowly Banksmith."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_11_1__a">"Location 11 - Brotherhood Monastery

The Brotherhood Monastery is a massive, sprawling estate located on the western edge of the city. Its architecture lacks the ostentation and flair you have seen elsewhere in the city, opting instead for pragmatism and function. Most of the members here are quite young, with the monastery serving as the institution responsible for readying many of Cistercia's children for a lifetime of service to the church. You question some of the brothers, but find no evidence the Venerator has been here.

An imposing building presents itself as the Tribunal hall. Guards love to talk, and you are sure to find some here. You ask if they have seen anything unusual in the last few days. They tell you someone broke into the dungeons just today, tried to free a mendicant, but he was quickly caught and awaits judgement alongside him now. Apart from that, they have seen nothing out of the ordinary, including your Venerator.

    <string name="chp7a_13_1__a">"Location 13 - The Market

The Market lacks the customary shouting and chaos found in other cities. Instead, ordered rows of merchant stalls fill the Market Square. Most of the customers are monks, clad in the various robes of their orders. You are sure a Venerator walking through here would garner some attention, but none is mentioned."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_14_1__a">"Location 14 - Cathedral

The golden spires of St. Josephus' Cathedral are visible from all over the city. Mass is about to begin, as crowds of nobles, monks and Ecclesia file inside. A priestess standing beside one of the entrances welcomes each soul who enters.

\"Pillar and Path, friends. Welcome…\" she says, motioning you inside. You politely refuse and inquire as to whether anyone has seen a Holy Venerator in the area recently. 

\"Oh, yes. We did, indeed,\" she replies with excitement and pride while maintaining a humble demeanor. \"Some of the Ascended come here to pray in the light of St. Josephus from time to time, but until yesterday I had never seen one for myself. I had been helping a sister prepare the prayer candles for today's service when I saw him. A Holy Venerator of Logos come to pray! Thank Justinia!\" 

She pauses for a moment, \"It was quite late in the evening. Close to midnight? That is odd,\" she wonders."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_15_1__a">"Location 15 - Aqueducts

One of the most impressive sights in Cistercia is the massive system of aqueducts which run throughout the city. Held aloft by enormous stone arches, the aqueducts direct water from the mountain runoff, down into the city and out to the farms at the perimeter. Without them, traditional farming would be impossible.

Walking along the incredible structures, you overhear a conversation between two monks. They discuss rumors that a Holy Venerator was seen at the Cathedral recently and it has spawned numerous theories as to its potential meaning.

    <string name="chp7a_16_1__a">"Location 16 - Village

The small villages surrounding Cistercia are connected to the main city by well maintained sections of The Wire Road that you can easily follow. You find a small village in the Deepwood, protected by a wood fence. The villagers go about their normal business, and have not seen anything."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_17_1__a">"Location 17 - Order of Dragons

You have heard of the Order of Dragons. Just like you, they are hunters. If the stories are true, damn good ones too. They may know of the Venerator and perhaps they know what kind of creature attacked you on the road outside of Verum."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_17_2__a">"You enter the hall and are greeted by a colossal monster skull suspended in the center of the room. With teeth as long as your arm, it shares a similar morphology to that of a snake or lizard, only a hundred times larger. 

\"Dragon,\" comments a stout, bearded man as he flips through a large book. \"At least that's the name they gave it. The records say this one was already dead when it was discovered. Nothing like it has ever been seen alive in recorded history.\" Something about it reminds you of the beast that sacked Bastone. The man returns the book to the shelf and looks to the marks on your wrists, \"Oathsworn. What brings you here?\"

You first inquire if anyone has seen a Venerator pass through. The man assures you they have not. Then you take out the sample of flesh you retrieved from the unknown horrors. Presenting it to him you explain you are also looking for information about a pack of creatures you encountered on your way to Cistercia.

The strange flesh piques the man's interest as he takes the sample carefully in hand, \"Come with me.\""</string>
    <string name="chp7a_17_4__c">"Shelves of sample jars and glass cases with dead specimens of Deepwood creatures take up an entire wing of the order hall. As you search them, you recognize some, most conjure memories of battles past and the scars that came with them. 

Your description of the encounter with the whip-armed horrors sends the man rifling through dozens of volumes with written accounts of various beasts. After some time however, it becomes clear there is no record of them."</string>

There is more to the riddle as well.\" He places the sample on an examination table and sets up a device with metal arms housing a series of glass lenses. He adjusts the lenses just right and studies the specimen. 

\"Look here. Do you see how these two areas of skin are completely different? It's as though they came from two separate creatures. And these small holes here, running along this ridge, they appear to have been stitched. Whatever this is, it has been made…\"

Laborers tend fields surrounded by high stone walls. You ask around for unusual happenings and hear stories of a shadow stalking the night the last few days, and some laborers going missing. Grimly reminded of the human remains you found in the burial tombs, you say nothing. One thing becomes clear - this did not happen here, but on the farms to the east.

Fields stretch out before you. You are not used to being able to see this kind of expanse without Deepwood trees or walls blocking your view. The effect feels… strange, almost relaxing. But you know better than to do that. How Cistercia came by such land is a question that remains unanswered. It does not seem to have the same overpopulation that similar cities suffer. Everything about this place makes you a little uneasy. When things seem too good to be true, they usually are. 

The stories you hear from farmers here are of a shadow stalking the night and peasants gone missing the next morning. Without an accurate description to work from, you decide to search the area for more clues."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_20_2__a">"In a nearby field, beside a bridge crossing a small stream, you discover a set of footprints still visible in the muddy ground. They are twice the size of an average man's and clearly come from armored feet. Following them, they appear to lead east."</string>

You travel to the village by The Wire Road. However, as you get closer, you realize it is too quiet. There is no one at the palisade walls surrounding the village. No one to challenge you. Even through the haze of the incoming fog you should see or hear someone. 

Something is wrong. You signal your comrades to silently draw weapons."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_22_1__a">"Location 22 - Village

Any journey into the Deepwood is a dangerous affair, and this trip is no different as a pair of beasts confront you as you try to navigate your way to the village. They look to be kin of the beasts you saw dead at the feet of the knights on your arrival. You hope you are up to the task."</string>

Your presence at the communal farm on this side of the city creates a stir and you are met with suspicion. It is rare for the farmers to see outsiders around here, let alone a Free Company. Most are hesitant to speak with you, but the few who do try their best to answer your questions. No one has seen anything unusual.

Not long after the Venerator began committing vile, blood soaked acts in the tombs above the city. Experimenting perhaps? It is hard to hide as a Venerator in the city, so it is likely he spent his days in the tombs and only came out at night for more victims. He has left his ritual site and gone. Where and why are yet to be answered.</string>
    <string name="chp7a_30_3__a">"Time Triggered Story

Searching the city for days now, you grow frustrated by your lack of progress. You finally catch a break when speaking with a group of farmers repairing a bridge near one of the communal farms. Traveling back from delivering produce to a nearby village, one spotted a set of massive armored footprints in a muddy field. He didn't think much of it at the time, but now that you ask, it was strange."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_4_1__a">"Location 4 - Order of the Word

The Order of the Word is the branch of the Justinian faith charged with enforcing the edicts and laws of the religion. Tucked safely away from prying eyes by its high walls, the massive compound also serves as the main headquarters of the Inquisition here in the city. 

Your Oathmark carries enough authority to earn you an audience with a high ranking member of the knightly order and a pair of guards escort you to a quiet area not far from the main gate where a woman cloaked in ornately embroidered robes waits. She does not introduce herself, instead getting straight to the matter. 

You are told the Venerator was briefly seen yesterday evening at the Order of Thorns and that his disappearance is of particular concern to her own order. Apparently, this Venerator was a brother of The Word before his ascension. \"As I am sure you understand, this must be handled with utmost discretion,\" she says with a grim stare. \"His shame is our shame. Please find him.\""</string>

You make your way up a winding mountain path towards the burial tombs. The rainy weather makes the mud slippery. You are the only souls who dare to make such a climb. Upon reaching the entrance, you find there are no guards stationed at the site, a rarity for holy landmarks in Cistercia. Instead, a lone pair of gargoyle statues flank either side of the tomb's large iron doorway. 

Stepping inside, the smell of embalming fluid mixed with rot and mold is suffocating and you are forced to relight the amber sconces which flickered out due to the rush of air caused by the opening doors. With a lit sconce in hand, you begin to search for clues."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_5_2__a">"The cavernous halls seem to go on forever. Hundreds of years, generations of heroes and honored dead, all lay in eternal rest with no one but each other to pass the time.

Following the blood trail deeper into the tomb, you find several coffins open, their stone lids pushed aside. The weight of the stone slabs would have required several men to move them. Or perhaps, one extremely strong one. The tracks point to the latter. A Venerator has been here.

The coffins are empty, but for a few scraps of rotten cloth. You find a room with a table and a couple of freshly burned down candles.

Fablemen say that the entirety of man's recorded history can be found within the tomes of Cistercia's Great Library. Seeing the immensity of it, you can well believe it.

Pushing open one of its masterfully carved oaken doors, you are received by an overwhelmed library clerk, carrying a stack of books and parchments. \"No more inquiries, please! We've had…\" his voice trails off as he sees the mark on Quintus' brooch. \"I beg your pardon, my lord!\" he pleads, dropping the stack as he collapses to his knees. \"I meant no offense!\"

\"We were told a most holy Venerator had recently been here,\" interrupts Quintus. \"Do you know of this?\"

\"The vault, my lord. The forbidden vault. His holiness made use of it, but that is all I know.\"

You note concern in Quintus' expression as he commands the librarian to rise with a simple gesture of his hand."</string>
    <string name="chp7a_7_3__a">"The librarian leads you to an area, sectioned off from the general public, in the building's basement. Pulling back a large purple curtain reveals a vast, heavily reinforced iron door, no doubt the forbidden vault.

Quintus instructs the man to open the door, but the librarian raises his hands apologetically, \"I am sorry, my Lord, the vault is sealed. It has been so since the holy one left. The artificers have been sent for,\" he adds, \"But they will not arrive for quite some time, I'm afraid.\"

Quintus waves him away like a bothersome fly. \"We don't have time to wait,\" he says, looking to you for ideas. You step forward and investigate the mechanism.

You can see the lock is deadbolted, but can be released with the right leverage. \"Careful, my lords!\" begs the librarian. \"It is said that the door is booby-trapped, one wrong move could set it off.\""</string>

Gouts of flame engulf the area in front of the door. Too slow to react, the charred remains of the librarian crumble to the floor.</string>

\"Heretical texts,\" Quintus offers, \"The product of sorcery and cults,\" moving his torch in a wide arc to illuminate the entire chamber. One of the tomes you pass appears to have the flayed face of a man stitched into its cover. You can only imagine the kind of power contained in these books, and stay clear of them.

Located within a formidable citadel adjacent to the inner city walls, is the Order of Thorns. From here the knights of the order patrol Cistercia's fortifications, ever vigilant in its defense. 

Opting for solitude, one of the knights sits between crenelations on the wall polishing his armor, chain by chain, in a meditative way. The knight pauses, taking in the crisp breeze blowing down from the mountaintops, he notices your presence. 

\"Pillar and Path, Oathsworn,\" he greets you, placing his shining steel pauldron carefully at his feet. You ask him if anyone from his order has mentioned seeing the Venerator.

If you kill any of the guards, or are detected in the dungeon, it could spark a crisis between the cities. You remind your party - if a guard spots you, make a break for it."</string>

A few moments pass, you hear his footfalls carry him down a flight of stairs, and up another. Then you hear a door in desperate need of oil squeak open. Moments later, a second door. Finally a bell rings, most likely a signal to other guards in the dungeon that all is well on this patrol. As the last echo from the bell fades the guard passes by you once again. 

From your vantage point, you see only two possible paths. One way leads to the left, and the other leads to the right. The wall in front of you most likely has prisoner cells on the other side.

Before you are able to clear the room, the guard spots you. \"Halt! What's your business here?\" he shouts. Time stands still. The look in your eyes tells the guard all he needs to know. Before he can draw his sword, you deliver a swift punch, knocking him unconscious."</string>

You hear the sound of a door opening and closing followed by footsteps on a set of stairs. Then, the familiar ring of the watch bell. His footsteps now more distant, you hear a second door open and close. Finally, quick footsteps take him on another set of stairs. A few moments later, his torch approaches once again.

With the path clear, you enter the prison cell area where barrels of burning amber cast an orange hue upon the cold, damp stone. Trying your hardest to ignore the lifeless sets of eyes staring blankly out from the rusty cell bars, you quietly ascend the wooden staircase ahead and make your way to the opposite end of the room undetected. Breathing a sigh of relief, you move deeper into the dungeon."</string>
    <string name="chp7b_12_35__a">After the first door creaks, you move. Heading straight, you pass through two doors and up a set of stairs.

You hear footsteps on two sets of stairs quickly followed by more footsteps on two sets of stairs, the sounds seem to come from both ends of the room. A bell rings twice, with only a brief interval between. Next you hear the clanking thud of two doors. There are two guards patrolling this area.

One of the guards travels his route a bit slower than the other, stopping to your left. He mumbles a few words. \"May you keep me on the path,\" then moves on. 

It will be difficult to avoid the guards. You see only two possible paths. A set of stairs on your left leading upward, and a path ahead leading to a wall some way off. Unfortunately, from your vantage point you cannot tell what is to your right. 

One wrong move here and Pyren is dead. You must choose carefully.

The light cast from the shrine reveals another staircase leading up to this second floor that you were previously unaware of. At that moment, you realize it is not the light from the shrine illuminating the second set of stairs, but the torch of a patrolling guardsman. \"Halt!\" he shouts, as he reaches for his sword. Before he is able to draw his weapon from its scabbard, you pummel him unconscious.</string>

Even in the darkness, the telltale signs of torture are impossible to miss. The disheveled man trembles, barely able to stand on his own. He won't make it out of here without help. Two of you flank Pyren, quickly toss his arms over your shoulders, and usher him from the cell. 

Hampered by Pyren's poor physical condition, you are forced to make slow, methodical moves while probing for an escape route. Thankfully, an opening finally presents itself and you use the distraction of a guard change to slip undetected from the dungeon. Now you must make your way to the rendezvous point on the outskirts of the city."</string>
    <string name="chp7b_12_51__a">"It is only a matter of time before someone discovers an unconscious guard. If you are caught down here, it will set off a diplomatic crisis between Cistercia and Verum. You need to flee the dungeon undetected and fast. 

Breaking the chains of a few cell doors, you need not urge the prisoners to make an escape. In the ensuing chaos, you are able to discreetly slip out of the dungeon without notice. As you make your way through the city, you hear the alarm bells of the Tribunal Halls fade in the distance. Father Pyren's fate is all but sealed. You knew the odds were slim, but it is still a difficult situation to swallow. You are left only with the consolation that you may still achieve your original objective and escort the mendicants of Cistercia back to Verum."</string>

\"At least we tried,\" Finnian offers, turning his back to compose himself. \"I need to ask a final favor, Oathsworn. Father Pyren has a family, it is against the law for mendicants to wed but he concealed their existence and kept them safe in a village beyond the walls. There is no telling what the Inquisition will force him to reveal If they discover his family, they will surely suffer the same fate. We sent a runner to retrieve them as soon as we heard Father Pyren had been imprisoned but they never returned. They must come with us, if we cannot save him, at least we can save them.\" Without hesitation, you agree and set out for the village at dawn."</string>

The golden spires of St. Josephus' Cathedral are visible throughout the city. You arrive just as mass is about to begin. Crowds of nobles, monks and Ecclesia file inside. Among them you see a group of guardsmen led by a man dressed like an officer of some sort. They each wear the sigil of the Tribunal Hall guard.

As you are about to follow them into the church, you spot a familiar face scanning the crowd - the Lord Marshall's adjutant, Quintus. Jaw clenched, he is clearly searching for you. You look for a safe path through the crowd."</string>
    <string name="chp7b_14_2__a">"You use the massive throng of people to conceal your movement into the Cathedral while keeping a watchful eye on Quintus. Fortunately, as the densely packed crowd begins to thin, Quintus continues his search elsewhere.

Slipping in at the back, you are able to take a seat in the pew directly behind the officer. Resting at his feet, you notice an open satchel with a journal inside. The journal might provide needed details of the patrol guards and their routes. You decide it is worth the risk to try and abscond with it, but you are going to need a distraction to pull this off.

    <string name="chp7b_14_3a__a">"You try to use the flowing tide of people for concealment, but you stick out like sore thumbs dressed in your battle gear. Suddenly, Quintus' deep voice resounds above the tide of parishioners like thunder, \"OATHSWORN! STOP!\" 

As he struggles to push his large frame through the crowd, you slip away and duck into a narrow alley a few blocks from the Cathedral."</string>
    <string name="chp7b_14_3b__a">"Waiting ample time to be sure the adjutant has moved on, you make your way back to the Cathedral and slip inside.

Slipping away from Quintus is easier than expected, and you reach the location Finnian described without any trouble. The area seems to be less frequented by people, making it the ideal spot for a discreet meeting. 

You find a small group of individuals dressed in simple garb gathered beside one of the Aqueduct's massive pillars. They are clearly nervous, constantly looking over their shoulders and avoiding eye contact with passersby. These must be the people you are here to meet with. Your approach sets them on edge, as they turn anxiously. Acknowledging you, one of them speaks, \"What brings you out on a day like this? Looks like rain, don't you think?\""</string>
    <string name="chp7b_15_2__c">"\"To wash away our sins,\" you reply. The men and women nod in deference and a sense of relief washes over them. It has been years since you left Cistercia and took the Oath, yet you still feel the pull of fellowship here. They warmly welcome you and your Company and thank you for your assistance.

\"Ah, you've already arrived,\" Finnian says as he joins the group.

He motions for you to follow him, \"Come, there is a place nearby where we can speak more privately. There is food and drink as well. I'm sure you have not had the chance to eat since arriving.\""</string>

\"The High Church has intensified their attacks on us, as of late. More and more of our brothers and sisters are apprehended every day to be tortured,\" Finnian pauses, exchanging a knowing glance with his friends. Despite being hunted like prey - a sentiment you know well - these people are clearly anchored by their faith. 

\"Your timing is fortunate. Many seek a new start beyond the city walls. We know of your purpose here in Cistercia. Word of the plague in Verum has reached our city. Our mendicants can help and we are prepared to return to Verum with you. However, before we can leave we must ask one thing of you, help us free Father Pyren. He is the one who gathered us and more than a few of us owe him our lives thanks to his miracles. We cannot leave without him.\"

You explain that if you are caught in the dungeons, or worse, if someone were to die, it would set off a political crisis between your two cities. Whatever happens has to be clean, if you have to choose between being detected and abandoning the mission you must choose the latter. 

Finnian nods, \"We can expect no more of you. In that case gaining access to the dungeons is the easy part. Getting to Father Pyren's cell, however, will be difficult. In order to reach him, you must ascertain the guard assignments and patrol routes of the three cell blocks where the prisoners are held. The dungeons are large and ill lit. If you know the guards' patrol routes, you should be able to get past them.\" He looks at you, as though he had just described a trip to the market. Clearly, he has more faith in pulling this off than you do. 

Finnian continues, \"One of the prison guards, Cecilla, is a sister of ours. She lives on one of the communal farms and should be able to help you.\" 

\"There is also the Proctor,\" adds a confident, raven-haired woman. \"If you're able to locate him, he may possess information concerning the guard assignments.\"

Despite the possible pitfalls going through your mind - you can see how it can be done. Helping these people in order to secure what you came for seems a fair bargain, and Finnian will join you, ensuring the pact. As you put down your empty bowl of stew, you choose to trust their word and give yours in return. 

Not long after you head out of the hall, to receive a blessing from those gathered, \"May she light your way.\" Knowing the shadows are your ally here, for your sake, you hope she doesn't."</string>

\"Yes, of course.\" Finnian smiles, after you ask about healing. \"Father Pyren has the gift more than any of us. but Norik here has it too.\" He motions to a young man dressed in the white robes of a mendicant. You are naturally wary of anything unusual yet eyeing the man your inquisitiveness gets the better of you. Norik places a hand on you and what happens next you cannot explain."</string>

Nothing like it has ever been seen alive in recorded history.\" Something about it reminds you of the beast that sacked Bastone. The man returns the book to the shelf and looks to the marks on your wrists, \"Oathsworn. What brings you here?\"

You first inquire if anyone has seen a Venerator pass through. The man assures you they have not. Then you take out the sample of flesh you retrieved from the unknown horrors. Presenting it to him, you explain you are also looking for information about a pack of creatures you encountered on your way to Cistercia.

You arrive at the rendezvous point and hand Father Pyren over to a small gathering of mendicants from The Way awaiting your arrival. Their relief and joy is silently shared so as not to draw unwanted attention. The mendicants, deeply grateful for your help, formally pledge their support to Verum. They tell you they will be ready to leave in a day. 

Before they depart, Father Pyren wishes to speak with you. \"Oathsworn,\" he wheezes, mustering whatever strength he has left. \"I owe you my life, but I would ask for one final kindness, if I may. There is a small village to the southeast. My wife and daughters are there.\"

At that Finnian steps in, \"We sent a runner to retrieve them as soon as we heard you had been imprisoned, but they never returned.\" Worry wrests control of Father Pyren's features as he tries to rise to his feet. With a forceful hand, Finnian easily pushes Father Pyren back to a seated position. \"You are in no condition to go, if you are to travel tomorrow, you must rest, Father.\"

Resigned, Father Pyren looks up at you with pleading eyes. \"Please, Oathsworn, will you bring them back to me?\"

This had not been part of the deal, but should you refuse the man he may do something foolish. The Inquisition will be looking for him, and should he, or another Low Church member be caught now the whole mission would be put in danger.

The foundation upon which the security of the Justinian religion rests is the Order of Towers. In faithful representation of that duty, the massive building is constructed from huge blocks of white stone and accented by ornately carved pillars around the perimeter. It is a veritable fortress in its own right. 

The brothers and sisters of the Order of Towers stand guard over the Citadel as well as all religious sites in the city. Donned in heavily reinforced armor and wielding deadly halberds, these warriors project the power and might of the church, reminding the faithful and heretics alike of the consequences dissent brings. 

Approaching the entrance you are met by two guardsmen who coldly stare you down from behind the column-like visors of their polished helms. Before you can speak, you spot a group of officers inside the order hall making their way toward the main entrance. Amongst the group is the familiar face of the Lord Marshall's adjutant, Quintus."</string>

Before long, you will join that man in pursuit of the true faith.

The Way."</string>

You finally managed to drive it up into the hills where the ever changing crevasses on the glacial terrain provided the opportunity to take the beast. And the plan worked, you cornered him at the edge of one of those deep fissures. The beast fought ferociously but you rammed the creature off the cliff and stood watching it disappear into the abyss below. It was a worthy first kill.

Every moment of the individual's life, from their birth until their death is recorded in painstaking detail. Only the person who actually experienced this life could have documented everything so thoroughly. A conflicting thought crosses your mind - if this is an autobiography, how could they have known the details of their own death?

You hold it high in the air and wait for final judgement from the masked man seated in the Master's Tents. Hovering for a moment, his outstretched fist extends a neutral thumb to the side. Then with an emphatic downward thrust, he turns his thumb toward the ground. A massive crowd roars in approval. 

You look down at the wounded warrior kneeling beside you. He was your brother before you stepped into the arena, but these barbaric games care nothing for the familial bonds of slaves. Memories of the childhood you shared with your brother race through your mind as you rest the edge of your sword against the back of his outstretched neck.

A voice in your mind tells you this beast tried to enter the Wychwood, but you stopped it. This is your purpose in life - grown to defend your homeland. 

Suddenly the woods around you morph into the sickly green of the Deepwood and you realize you are farther from your home than ever before. You are out of her reach and she can no longer compel you to return. You have broken free of her control. After quiet reflection, you wonder if you should go to the Tree Killers.

Her many eyes rise slowly above the edge of the web, each one locked on you with haunting bloodlust, followed by her hairy, sack-laden abdomen. Long, chitinous legs, twice as long as spears, carry her effortlessly across the web with a grace that belies her massive form. Finally, you see the cocooned child still locked in the spider's grotesque mandibles.

The light of the twin orange suns glints off her hard, black carapace as she crosses the web, searching for just the right moment to strike. When she turns, you get a better look at her back and realize she has added another victim to her count. Wrapped in a silken cocoon and suspended from her dorsal armor is a second child.

She dances and skips around in a circle as she sings. The worn furrow in the dirt and the raw flesh on her feet tell you she has been skipping for a very long time.

Your attempts to get her attention go ignored, as though you do not exist. Finally, you lift her into your arms and try to still her.

When you set the statue back on the map, the world around you shatters like glass. Countless shards of unreality swirl in a torrent of chaos. Suddenly, your gut twists and the shattered pieces recombine. You find yourself standing on the crest of a hill overlooking a mammoth, bottomless chasm."</string>
    <string name="chp8_20_1__c">"Suspended above the chasm, you see a giant spider web, stretched across the abyss like a tarp and anchored by five, thick cables of webbing. Each silken cable extends toward various scenes that look as though a collage of unrelated landscapes has been mashed together.

In the distance, you recognize one of the landscapes as the ruins of a great city. Another appears to be a spot of dark, greenish forest. One of the cables leads to a huge mountain rising high into the clouds. Another, to a lonely cottage listing to one side atop its foundation. And the final cable leads to some kind of monument that you cannot quite make out from this distance. 

At last, in the center of the web, broods an eight-legged horror the size of a house. The hairy arachnid tends to a child-size cocoon that appears to be suspended by nothing at all.

Materializing out of nowhere, Lina steps beside you. She points toward the spider, \"She eats the fear. Fear is her power. If you overcome your fear, she won't be able to feed and she'll become weak. Then you can kill her and free the child.\""</string>
    <string name="chp8_20_1__e">"As you return your attention to the spider, you find she has picked the cocoon up in her giant maw. Her many eyes fixated upon you, the spider crawls down into the chasm with great care and is swallowed up by the darkness.

It looks like you will need to weaken the web in order to lure the beast back.

 \"Gone?\" he replies, puzzled. \"We were discussing what to do about the townsfolk when suddenly you froze. You looked like they do.\" he says, motioning to the enthralled villagers.

Coming upon the entrance to a cave mouth, you see children bound like marionettes in the trees, their glowing orange eyes silently scanning the area like sentries. This is exactly how you found Gamel's son just before you encountered…

The Satyr's massive frame crouches next to some small cages as with paternal care, it carefully places a wailing child into one.

Inside the cages, you recognize a few of the little faces belong to the children you saved from the realm of madness. These lucky few cry and tremble at the sight of the massive beast, while others among them stand silently, lost under the Satyr's sway. 

The Satyr taps a tree-size staff against the wooden bars of each cage he passes, sending a ripple of fear through the conscious children. Each time, the creature draws in a long, deep breath, literally inhaling the terror it has generated. 

When the beast turns back in your direction, you see there is a girl bound to the top of the giant staff. You recognize her. 

It's Lina! 

Thanks to the image from her, you know where the sentinels are and think you can find a way to the Satyr without raising the alarm. The time has come to end this, once and for all."</string>

The Venerator lies dead before you. Even with this victory, terrified, hopeless eyes look to you as townsfolk gather round. Mothers sob while fathers and neighbors try to reassure them that everything will be okay. All of the children have inexplicably disappeared. Dozens of tiny footprints in the mud by the village's main gate ominously suggest they may have fled into the Deepwood. Considering the carnage that has taken place within the walls of the village over the last few days, it is of small wonder what may have driven them to risk running into the forsaken woods. 

\"The children couldn't have gone far,\" one says. 

\"The Oathsworn will find them,\" promises another, looking up at you with unfounded hope. This is not your task here, and the hour is getting late for Verum. You know you must return soon with the Mendicants or many more lives will be lost. There is more at stake here than one village.

You look away from the need in the villagers eyes and face the village Banksmith. \"Thank you Oathsworn,\" he says. \"Without you, we would have been just like the others or worse. My wares are yours, take what you will. I owe you that much.\""</string>
    <string name="chp8_21_1__c">"Nodding to the Banksmith you take in the scene. Several townsfolk continue to sway in an invisible breeze, staring expressionlessly into nothing. \"Something is still bewitching them,\" the Banksmith adds. With the Venerator's lifeless body laying in a pool of his own blood, it is clear he is not the source of this witchcraft. You survey the Venerator's corpse, your attention drawn to the book he was carrying as it lays unceremoniously in a puddle of blood beside him. Wrapped in charred leather, and bound by thick iron chains, there is something wholly unsettling about the book."</string>

As the trail opens up into a large clearing, you make out two diverging paths ahead. To your right, there is a sign post with a broken wooden horse resting at its base. To your left, a dense fog that prevents you from seeing what lies beyond.

As you draw your weapons, a child, Lina, appears before you. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"He's lost too.\"

You cautiously approach the hulking warrior with your weapons at the ready, just in case. As you draw closer, the man continues to stand with his back toward you, his armor neatly arranged at his feet. Blood trickles from dozens of cuts on his upper body, and dark bruises mar the areas of flesh between them.

The cottage's ramshackle construction appears as if it could barely survive a stiff breeze, yet the cable from the spider's massive web is anchored to its wooden roof. In the gloom, you see no windows and a lone door sits ajar. There is something hauntingly familiar about this lonely place. Cautiously, you enter.

You made a promise, you had taken the contract, you gave your Oath. Now you are about to break that promise. The family is on the bed holding tight to one another. It will do no good, the Thing is in the room with them. It does not kill the ones it takes, it does worse than that. You lie on the floor, your body broken. Every breath brings convulsions of pain.

You see the first humans, deliciously ignorant and ripe, as they struggle to survive. You whisper to them from the shadows. Guiding them. Controlling them. You play your macabre games like a little god over them. 

But then she came, and they no longer hear the whispers in the dark. Revolted by her, you withdraw and bide your time.

\"You are mine! You're never getting out…\" she taunts, louder and louder. \"Never getting out… NEVER GETTING OUT!\" The last denial is a deep beastial voice.

Lina suddenly screams in agony as rays of dark light shoot out from her eyes. You dive out of the way and see there are now hallways leading away from the room. Each path appears to lead to more and more and more passageways. You will need to find your way through the maze."</string>

Down one passage, you find a black door at the end. As you run toward it, the hallway seems to grow longer and longer as the door draws further and further away from you. No matter how fast you run, you cannot seem to get any closer. 

You blink your eyes and suddenly you find yourself standing back in the village outside of Cistercia."</string>
    <string name="chp8_30_1__a">"Red Sands

You open your eyes and spit red sand. You find yourself lying in a desert staring up at a pair of orange suns that struggle to illuminate a darkened sky.

Rising to your feet, your Company at your side, each of you instinctively draws your weapons at the first sense of approaching danger. You are clearly not in the Deepwood any longer. 

\"You're new,\" observes a tiny voice behind you. Whipping around, you see a girl where there was only sand a moment ago. Her clothing is similar to the style worn by the villagers around Cistercia. 

Curiously eyeing your group she smiles pleasantly, revealing a charming set of dimples. \"I'm Lina,\" she continues. \"He's got you too, now…\" 

She then giggles and skips away. \"Come with me!\" she calls back, kicking up sand as she dances away.

Unless you want to wait around, you have no choice but to follow the child into the desert. Her tiny feet barely break the surface as she flits effortlessly over the sandy terrain while you struggle to keep pace under the weight of your armor. An uneven patch catches you unaware and you stumble face first, placing a hand to the ground to stop your fall. The loose silt does not feel like sand as you quickly realize you are now walking through an ashy waste of burnt, pulverized bone.

You continue to walk for what feels like an eternity. It is impossible to get a sense of time or distance in this place, but oddly, you do not tire or crave sustenance. You wonder if this is what death feels like?

Finally you arrive at the edge of a forest, which like the girl, seems to appear out of nowhere.

\"This is new,\" the girl says, motioning toward the trees. \"You brought this. Nothing ever changes here, but this appeared when you arrived.\"

You follow the child as she ducks beneath low hanging branches and pushes herself through the underbrush."</string>
    <string name="chp8_3_1__a">"Location 3 - Foggy Swamp

As you place the statue back on the map, you are overcome by nausea. The world around you suddenly falls away, light collapsing into a single point until there is nothing but darkness. Then, as quickly as it disappeared, a new reality blinks back into existence."</string>
    <string name="chp8_3_1__c">"You overlook a grim valley filled with a thick ominous fog. Skeletal trees poke through the grayish mist, each reaching for the twin orange suns as they watch menacingly from above. As you move down into the valley, your boots sink into the muddy ground and a rancid odor rises to fill your nostrils.

Somewhere in the dark and gloomy distance you hear the faint singing of a child."</string>
    <string name="chp8_3_3__a">"The fog here is so thick, you can barely see your own hand in front of your face. A foul layer of murky grime covers every tree, plant and stone. You fight just to draw breath in the heavy air.

Deeper in the valley the singing grows louder, and you realize it is not just one child, but a whole chorus of them. The song, like the twisted version of a nursery rhyme. 

He is coming, won't be long.

Good children do right not wrong.

Tie a ribbon on the tree

Do not stray or run or flee.

See a shadow, hear the thud. 

Hear the silence, see your blood.

Through the fog, you see two orange orbs in the distance. As you draw closer, you find they are a pair of iron-wrapped amber lanterns swaying above a post with two signs. Neither sign has anything written on it and each points in the opposite direction. 

As you wonder which way to go, the children continue to sing the rhyme.

This has already happened, it cannot be real. As you think this and turn around, you see the swamp before you again and hear the rhyme being sung.

The bloody gashes on the body remind you of wounds left by the sharp claws and teeth of a rat. You immediately recognize the woman as one of the townspeople you failed to save from the clutches of the Broodmother. You had been too slow to reach her and she died, alone, gnawed to death by dozens of rats. Suddenly her eyes flash open.

You approach The Crumbling City, its once mighty walls broken and its buildings crumbling with age. As you pass under a stone arch entryway the scene changes. 

You are in The Broken Oak in Verum. The tavern is empty, its tables dusty and the fire long out, giving the room an icy chill. You go to rise from the chair you are in, but find resistance. Your bones ache and creak. You look at your hands, liver spots cover your wrinkled flesh. You are old. 

You try to remember why you were getting up, but your mind is foggy. Were you somewhere else? No, you were always here, always in this hall surrounded by the memories of the past. Glories never to be relived. Your strength is now gone and your purpose along with it. No use, no value, no…"</string>

She tells you she wants to get down, but she is afraid she will fall. After a few reassuring words, she extends one of her tiny hands. As you take hold, she vanishes.</string>
    <string name="chp8_7_1__a">"You stand on an old wooden platform, high up in the trees of the Deepwood. Below you, nothing but mist and darkness. Ahead, you catch a glimpse of a child in pigtails as she jumps from branch to branch heading deeper into the cursed forest. 

You give chase, carefully navigating the maze of thick tree limbs until you come upon a wide gap too large to cross. The young girl has somehow made it to the other side where she stands on another wooden platform staring back at you. 

Spanning the wide gap, you see four platforms, each suspended from on high by a set of ropes. You notice that the web of ropes can be traced back to an odd mechanism containing a series of levers situated on the branch where you now stand. As you pull one of the levers, some of the platforms raise and lower. You try a few more to see which levers correspond to the various platforms. You realize that each lever can only be pulled ONCE. You will need to decide the proper order to activate the levers in order to make your way across before they reset."</string>

When you arrive with your group this time, the mysterious figure is nowhere to be seen. The Oathstone itself, thankfully still stands in the clearing - unspoiled by the corruption of the Deepwood.

A sinking feeling washes over you as you find yourself suddenly in a wet, subterranean tunnel much like the Underways. People rush past you, fleeing deeper into the tunnel as a torrent of water barrels toward you. The roaring flood slams into you with the force of a charging bull and smashes you against the tunnel walls. Your world goes black momentarily, and you suddenly find yourself back in the library.</string>
    <string name="chp8_8_5__a">With the book in hand, the letters on the spine reorganize themselves to spell, \"Not Right\". The smell of burnt flesh wafts into your nostrils as the world around you is suddenly engulfed in flames. The entire village is ablaze, and so are you. You run frantically toward the stone well in the center of the settlement, flames burn your lungs with each heaving breath. The pain is unbearable. Without hesitation, you dive headlong into the cool blackness of the well. Darkness flashes, and you are once again back in the library.</string>
    <string name="chp8_8_6__a">"Rearranging the letters, you see the book is titled, \"The Oath\". This is what binds you together. What keeps you alive. As you take the book, you feel the thick steel cable of The Wire Road in your hand. 

You remember this part of the path. It is on the way to The Oathstone. This is the last test all initiates take before they receive their brand. One more day and night in the Deepwood is all it will take. You should be alone, but you are not. Your Company is together, sharing this experience."</string>
    <string name="chp8_8_7__a">You see the letters on the spine shuffle and reorder themselves to say, \"Read Another\". As the book begins to disintegrate in your hands, you lose consciousness before a scream snaps you awake - your own scream. You find yourself lying in the muck of the Deepwood. You try to stand, but quickly realize your legs are not there. Above you a shadow looms. You turn over just in time to see a gaping maw bite down on your face. Suddenly, you find yourself safe in the library once again with all of your limbs accounted for.</string>

You rush to where the Satyr dropped its massive staff and quickly untie the ropes that still bind the young girl, Lina, to it. She is unconscious, but still alive.

The girl's clothing is clearly that of Verum, not Cistercia. There's no telling how long she had been held captive by the sadistic beast. One thing is for certain, the power she channeled on that staff was terrifying. You do not know who she will be when she wakes up.

In the palm of one of her lifeless hands you find the control rod snapped in two. Before she died she managed to break it along with any chance of you using the Golem again. 

As you gaze down at the body, the rest of the Free Company appears at your side and informs you that the assassins have retreated back into the night and that the Golem has gone dormant.

With the danger seemingly over for now, you look more closely at the woman's corpse in the hopes of finding a clue as to who these people are and why they attacked you."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_13__a">"You find no letters or any other belongings on the woman's corpse. However, as you investigate further, you notice a strange lump beneath the skin of her arm surrounded by a jagged scar. Using her knife, you lance the bulge and find a bloody sliver of white amber gemstone planted beneath the skin. You have never seen anyone do something like this to themselves. Strangely, as you study the stone, you swear you can hear a voice whisper at the edge of your mind. Is this what the Watcher wanted you to find?

With the search complete, you return to the tavern and find the establishment empty, only the slumped form of the Golem remains. Even the innkeeper has fled. With the control rod broken you will not be forcing your way into many other places in the village. Someone does not want you making inquiries."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_14__a">"You find no letters or any other belongings on the woman's corpse. Although more than a dozen had tried to kill you, you still do not know who they are or what is going on here.

With the search complete, you return to the tavern and find the establishment empty, only the slumped form of the Golem remains. Even the innkeeper has fled. With the control rod broken, you will not be forcing your way into many other places in the village. Someone does not want you making inquiries."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_15__a">"Confident the cloaked figures won't attack again tonight, you try to use the last few hours of twilight to rest. Morning comes without further disruption and after heading downstairs to scrape together enough food for a meal in the empty tavern, you weigh your options. 

There is something more than just a Deepwood creature casting a shadow over this village. It takes a particular type of zealotry or madness to attack a fully armed Free Company, and equally strange is the fact that the tavern has been completely abandoned. Something is very wrong in Glimhollow. 

Your orders were to reopen the amber supply lines and search for evidence of the white amber the Watcher is so keen to get his hands on. The Mayor did seem sincere in his desire to reopen the routes to Verum, but to do that you first need to find and kill the alleged creature. That said, how secure would a supply line be with a roving band of cloaked assassins loose? Perhaps there is a connection between last night's attack and the white amber? Either way, you suspect you won't need to go far to find answers in this village. Things tend to find their way to you around here."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_16__a">"As you piece together what you know so far, some of the evidence does not add up. This village is supposed to be one of the longest surviving settlements near Verum. If this area were the den or hunting grounds of some kind of creature, it surely would have begun attacking long ago and perhaps even prevented Glimhollow from lasting so long. Experience tells you the villagers must be involved in some kind of activity that has lured the beast here.

Speaking to the villagers may help shed some light on this assumption. An investigation of the wall where the creature last broke through could also provide clues as to the nature of the beast. There is also the strange note you found from the village Apothecary, Zelah. She seems eager to speak with you."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_17__a">"You decide it's best to avoid the drama unfolding in this village and focus on the specific orders in your contract, which is to reopen the amber supply lines. The fastest way to accomplish that is to find out what this creature is and kill it. Information regarding the most recent attack would be useful and with any luck you may be able to identify a weakness in the creature that you can exploit or at least determine where it comes from. With less than a day until the coming of the beast you set to your task."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_1__a">Location 14 - The Tavern</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_1__c">"Having made good progress, and with the hour drawing late you retire to the village tavern. The inn is rather unremarkable by most standards. The one thing that does stand out is the eerie lighting in the room created by the reflection of the lit sconces against the amber-laced timber used for the walls, floors and every piece of furniture in the establishment. 

After paying for the night's stay, an old, hunchback of a woman greets you curtly and waves a crooked thumb toward the stairs, directing you up to the bedrooms. Despite resistance from the tavern's proprietor, you decide to bring the Iron Golem into the inn and station it outside your room. 

As you stow your gear for the night, one of you discovers a piece of parchment on a bedside table. Curious, you open the paper and read it.

\"Meet me at the apothecary tomorrow. I need to speak with you. ~Zelah\"

The remainder of the evening is spent downstairs in the common room by the bar, passing the time in conversation much like you would back at The Broken Oak. The atmosphere here, however, is far different, as all eyes seem to repeatedly find their way back to you throughout the night."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_2__a">"Before a round of drinks is delivered to your table, one of you glimpses a servant drop something into each of your mugs. You quickly inform the group as the act can only mean one thing - an ambush. You signal your companions to get ready to leave. The common room is a bloody place to be ambushed in, you can only hope they want to take you while you sleep. Not wanting to tip your hand, you pretend to drink from the tainted mugs and feign you are none the wiser. Eventually, you rise from the table and retire for the evening. Luckily, no one moves to hinder your ascent up the stairs. 

With the Golem stationed outside your room, the decision is made to sleep in your armor and a rotating watch is established. Every Free Companyman learns to sleep knowing they may die in the night and this evening will be no different. 

Your suspicions are confirmed in the early morning hours when a tap on your shoulder wakes you. A silent hand gesture from your companion directs your attention toward the floor where a hatch concealed under a rug slowly opens and a dark shape begins to emerge. The would-be assassin never stood a chance, as one of your blades finds their throat. Suddenly, a voice shouts from below and more concealments burst open in the walls and ceiling as a gang of cloaked figures rushes into the room with daggers drawn. All pretense of stealth gone, the room erupts into a close quarters melee."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_2__c">The fight turns in your favor, recognizing their inevitable defeat several of the figures break and retreat. One not being able to reach the exit, turns and dives for the window. Crashing through it, you notice the control rod for the Golem clutched in their hand. Without pause, you dive after them.</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_3__a">"With your senses on high alert you train a watchful eye on every soul in the room, but when the server finally brings your drinks to the table, you permit yourself a brief moment to enjoy it. The ale is surprisingly good and unexpectedly strong. The cool, stiff drink helps to soothe you and you actually manage to relax for the first time in days. After some time, however, you feel the weight of your journey bear down on you once again and the decision is made to turn in for the night. You can't recall the last time you felt this tired. 

Back in your room, you repeat the command for the Iron Golem to stand guard outside your door. Then the world starts to spin and you find it difficult to stay on your feet. As you stumble toward your bed, everything goes black.

You wake in the dead of night with a pounding headache. Slowly sitting up, your vision clears just in time to witness the horror of the Iron Golem as it bears down on one of your companions and snatches them up in its massive hand. In a rush, you frantically search for the control rod, but it's not there. Your companion groans in agony as the last bit of air is squeezed from their lungs. If you do not act quickly, it will crush the life out of them."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_3__c">"One of you smashes the Golem with a wooden chair, but the chair simply shatters against its iron shell. Changing tactic they grasp the fingers of the Golem and with all their might, pry at them. It looks like they might budge. Struggling to your feet, you realize you must get that control rod back before the Golem claims a life. 

As you glance around the room, you catch a glimpse of a silhouette outside the bedroom window. The dark figure stands in the slanted rain of the muddy street below with what looks like the control rod pointed directly at the room. 

At that very moment, the door to your room bursts open, revealing several cloaked figures in the hallway outside, each with daggers at the ready."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_7__a">The cloaked figures pour into the room, and are immediately upon you with a flurry of stabbing thrusts. More than a few find their way past your armor.</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_8__a">"The assailants outnumber you by at least five to one. Despite their poor armor and simple iron weapons, they will overrun you in seconds if you don't manage to keep them out of the room. Your only hope is to secure the doorway, and fast."</string>
    <string name="chp9_14_9__a">In the midst of the chaos, you dive through the second story window. Shards of glass shatter in all directions as you land in the soft mud below. The figure holding the control rod bolts as soon as you get to your feet.</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_1__a">"Location 18 - The Main Gate

Veins of amber weave their way through the wooden planks of the village's main gate. Not an uncommon sight for a small village this far from a proper city, as Deepwood timber is often the only building resource one has available to them. 

The passageway is barely wide enough for a two-ox cart to fit through and the gate itself is set against a heavy ridge of stone, preventing it from being easily battered down or forced open. Thick, horizontal bands of iron fortify the gate doors, a clear sign that the designers knew what they were doing. 

As you examine the gate further, you notice that the iron bands are heavily rusted and the wood beneath is charred. This gate has clearly withstood several assaults in its days and the countless teeth marks in its surface leave no doubt as to the nature of the assailants.

Just then, you hear the sound of bow strings being pulled taut.

\"Halt!\" cries a voice. \"No outsiders may enter, lest they draw the beast!\"

You look up to see several guards on the parapet with bows trained directly on you. The guards appear nervous, but at such close range there is little chance of them missing their mark. Brandishing the Oathmarks on your wrists, you explain that you come by order of the King and promise them that if their bows are not lowered immediately, the beasts of the Deepwood will be the least of their worries.

The Guards unconsciously begin to lower their bows then pause as they remember their orders. You can see they are about to draw again. They would draw against the Oathmark? This is not how this should be going.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_3__a">"As they go to draw, you dive into the shelter of the wall. 

Turning to the Golem, with the control rod in hand, you command it to break the gate down.

Its glowing eyes flare as the massive construct stamps forward. A rain of arrows ping off its dark iron shell, doing nothing to deter it. Its bulk slams against the gate and its braces with the grind of iron.

More arrows are loosed through murder holes, but to no avail.

The gates splinter around the Golem. With heavy groans the banded iron bends, warps then finally sheers in two as the gates peel open. The unnatural feeling washes over you again as you stare at the immense power of the Golem. The Watcher had known it would be needed to gain access to the village. You snap out of your reverie before the guards overcome their shock at what just happened. You move quickly into the village and with little resistance the guards lay down their arms."</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_3__c">"The guards that were threatening you kneel before you, resigned to a man. They dared to raise weapons against the mark, a crime that is punishable by death everywhere in the pact. Could they be of more use alive though?


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_4__a">"You nearly order the Golem forward but stay the command at the last moment. They are fools to raise weapons against the mark, but the Deepwood is a capricious place and fond of tricks. Who knows what they have seen from those walls.

You raise your voice and using the full weight of The Pact, remind the guards of the inevitability of their circumstance. You will gain entry to the village, one way or another. The guards hesitate, their eyes flit from you to the Golem and back again. 

You can see the conflict and you see the moment to assure them. \"We're here to kill your monster,\" you say. 

From within the Deepwood something groans, fell and horrifying. The guards visibly shrink back, but whatever it is, it seems to convince them at last to allow your entry. One disappears from the wall, and a moment later, the gate creaks open, its mighty hinges groaning."</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_4__c">You are welcomed by a crowd of suspicious faces and the guard captain, who quickly orders the gates shut again. The villagers gathered around the gatehouse keep their distance, yet there is an odd defiance in their eyes that you are not used to seeing from the peasantry. Something seems off. Approaching the captain you ask him to take you to the leader of the village. You need to find out why this village has gone dark.</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_5__a">"Your words fail to sway the guards. In fact, they seem to have the opposite effect, as they refocus their bows on you and their resolve to defend the village appears even more resolute.

It seems you have but one option left."</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_6__a">"If you allow these men to defy The Pact, others will surely follow, endangering the lives of all Free Companymen. You won't let that happen. As you raise your weapons, the guards see their fate in your pitiless eyes. The earth beneath their bodies is soon stained red.

The Pact cannot be broken.

The villagers pull back in fear as you single out a timid man who seems compliant enough to help you without the need for further 'motivation'. You demand that he escort you to whoever is in command of the village at once. The first order of business is to find out why communication with Verum was cut off."</string>
    <string name="chp9_18_7__a">"You are well within your rights to execute these men where they stand. If you allow them to defy The Pact, others will surely follow, endangering the lives of all Free Companymen. Looking at their faces though, you see fathers, and sons - not guards. These commoners would not be the only ones to suffer your judgement should you choose to execute it. 

Relenting, you urge them off their knees and make it clear that their forthrightness is no longer an option. Your tone brooks no argument, your word is law. The guards nod, clearly grateful, and lead you into the village. The unexpected second chance at life succeeds in loosening their lips."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_10__a">"Suddenly the main door swings open and a hush sweeps across the bar. You look toward the entrance and see a cloaked figure wielding a raven-headed staff as he enters the inn. Cups and utensils clatter as patrons abandon their tables and quickly exit the common room. Bram cleans the glass he is holding even more vigorously, trying to conceal his nervous hands.

\"What is a Watcher doing here?\" Graycane whispers as he turns his head away in deference.

There is little in this world that would warrant the presence of a Watcher in your establishment. They rarely leave The Raven Spire or the King's side.

Looking through the open door, you also see a pair of glowing eyes, taller than any normal human, smoldering in the rainy night behind the cloaked figure. You are no stranger to the stories of the automatons who stand guard at the gates of The Raven Spire, their massive bulk given life by unknown powers.

Never before have you seen an Iron Golem close up, until this moment."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_11__a">"You approach the Watcher tentatively. The hooded face turns to you. So do the dimly glowing eyes behind. A sense of power exudes from them that has you mentally checking your Company's positions in the room. 

The Watcher's voice, when it finally speaks, rasps across the room, \"I come bearing a contract for you, Oathsworn. In obligatum. Your recent successes have earned you much trust with the Crown and a matter has arisen that requires only the most dependable assets. Glimhollow, an amber harvesting village, has gone silent. You will investigate the reason why. If they are besieged, free them. If they are rebellious, tame them. If they are dead, avenge them.\" 

In obligatum, again. Most Free Companies see no more than one in a lifetime but you have had two back to back. You have heard whispers of Free Companies being 'chosen' by the Raven Spire for special attention. Every contract survived, only proving the value of the Company, and increasing their chance of being 'chosen' for the next vital mission. For these unlucky souls, the cycle was usually only broken in one way, death. Casting the thought aside, you focus on the task before you."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_12__a">"\"Glimhollow is one of the longest surviving outposts in the Deepwood. Not more than a day's journey from here, it is responsible for harvesting much of the amber used throughout Verum. If the supply line is not reestablished soon, the city will face a cold, dark winter.


Choose one:

If you have asked two question, choose the top option. Otherwise, pick a different question."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_13__a">"The Watcher glances briefly over his shoulder to the figure with the glowing eyes, \"Another asset of considerable worth. He will accompany you on your journey.\" 

You gaze at the Iron Golem as it stands stock-still in the rainy night. Amber lanterns reflect off its black surfaces, clearly dark iron in construction. There is something unnatural about the thing, as though life exists where it should not.

    <string name="chp9_19_14__a">"The answer to your question comes in the form of deliberate silence.

    <string name="chp9_19_15__a">"The Watcher stares at you. \"That which has been given, can easily be taken away,\" he coldly rasps. A not-so-subtle reminder of where the title to The Broken Oak came from.


Choose one:

If you have asked two question, choose the top option. Otherwise, pick a different question."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_16__a">"From the shadow of his cowl, the Watcher studies your faces for a long moment. Seemingly satisfied, he continues, \"There is a second matter which also requires your attention in Glimhollow, Oathsworn. One that is not to be spoken of beyond this room, nor will it be found in your contract. Amber serves many vital purposes to the kingdom beyond mere lamp light. Many other… uses. A rare form of it has been found in Glimhollow. The village has used its possession of this amber supply to resist past inspection, but it is time they returned to the fold. You must gain access to this village one way or another and return the amber to us. No one can know of this purpose.\" 

The Watcher's eyes narrow, beckoning your attention, \"But be warned. Great care must be taken not to touch the gemstones with bare flesh. The effects would be rather… unpleasant.\" 

The Watcher places a sealed scroll on the bartop, undoubtedly your contract, and curiously sets a small, metal rod beside it. Without another word, he slips out the main entrance leaving the enormous golem behind.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_17__a">"When you pick up the metal rod, the glowing eyes of the Iron Golem immediately turn toward you as if awaiting your command. 

\"A control rod,\" Greycane says with awe, peeking over your shoulder. 

The rod is light, barely heavier than a coin, and made of a single piece of strange metal. Within the sealed scroll you find a basic set of instructions on how to command the golem followed by a single warning.

\"Do not remove the muzzle.\"


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_18__a">"The Iron Golem is massive. Easily weighing more than a full grown bull, its broad feet are all that keep it from sinking into the mud. Thick arms and thicker legs, forged from dark iron, mimic the human form, only swollen to gigantic proportions. Its icy white eyes stare blankly from a featureless head with a metal plated gag buckled securely over its mouth.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_19__a">"You unbuckle the heavy muzzle caging the golem's face and see a slight gash where the mouth should be. Suddenly, its eyes dim and the unformed mouth lets out an unholy scream. You fumble with the muzzle, desperately trying to reattach it as a crippling screech threatens to destroy your eardrums and rivulets of blood begin to trickle from your nose and ears."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_19__c">"As waves of pain rack your mind you grip the buckle, and with great effort, force the mask back into place. It takes several minutes for your heartbeat to slow and your hearing to return to normal.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_1__a">"You finally arrive in Verum, scarred and weary from your journey through an unforgiving Deepwood. It was a long trek, but you have returned with the Mendicants you were sent for. As you enter the city, horns blow and cheers go up from crowds gathered to see the 'Heroes of Bastone' return along with their salvation from the plague. It seems the cryers have been earning their iron of late, planting hope in your mission. You note, even in their jubilation, members of the crowd try to keep their distance from one another.

Upon your arrival you are met by a group of officials who quickly usher away the Mendicants, no doubt to be put straight to work as the city can spare no time for rest. Without stopping, you break free from the crowd and head deeper into the city. The shadow of this plague seems to have grown since you left. The few people in the streets scuttle from one door to another and everyone has scarves or handkerchiefs drawn tightly across their noses and mouths. You feel the temptation to quicken your steps, but resist. To give into fear is to lose the battle, whether here or in the Deepwood. Your wariness doesn't ease until you see the sign of The Broken Oak swaying in the breeze. 

You have only been its owners for a few months and actually lived in it for less than half that time, but with the ministrations of Greycane and Bram it has started to feel like home. A few days of rest and some hearty meals see your injuries healing."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_1__c">"An official from the Crown visits the inn during this time and dumps a sack of iron on the table for your 'aid to the city'. By the size of the sack, it seems Verum may not be worth very much, but the man expresses regret that the King's coffers are currently strained by the plague. He also reminds you the contract to retrieve the Mendicants had been 'in obligatum' - so it could not have been refused. A danger of the job, all Free Companies are required to accept such contracts when they are issued from The Raven Spire or the Crown itself. Refusal would have meant death at the hands of another two or three Free Companies sent to hunt you down."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_1__e">The days continue to pass, one into the next.</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_21__a">"Just as you prepare for the journey, Lyceen comes down a ladder she has put up that goes on to the roof of the Oak. She has a bundle in her arms. \"I heard we're moving out again - so soon already… I have harvested the first batch of herbs early for this.\"

She hands you the bundle, it is full of various healing herbs that Lyceen has been growing on the roof of the Broken Oak. Every bit of space is made use of in the city and your Tavern is no different. With thanks you accept the gift."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_22__c">"The streets are still a soggy mess as you make your way to Verum's main gate. The few merchants and servants out at this hour give you a wide berth and whisper blessings or prayers to ward off evil spirits as you pass. Gears grind, opening the massive city gate just a sliver, barely enough to squeeze your frames through the doors. It seems no one is taking any chances tonight. The guards on the wall bid you farewell with a nod as you step once again into the Deepwood.

According to the Watcher, Glimhollow should be only a day's march away, but with the paths along The Wire Road drenched from ceaseless rainfall, your progress slows to a crawl. Each of your steps sinks in mud up to your knees and the entire party is waterlogged. The Iron Golem, however, seems to have no trouble at all wading through the mire. 

The treacherous footing inevitably causes delays and you are forced to make camp as twilight begins to fall. The cold, wet night drags on for what feels like an eternity. The sole distraction from your discomfort is in watching the firelight play across the black hull of the Iron Golem as it stands, statuesque in the mud, with its haunting stare. 

The last half of the journey is uneventful by Deepwood standards. No terrors threaten you and there are no monsters to bar your way. If anything, it feels as though the hellish wood is holding its breath. Waiting. 

You sense the village is near when you begin to pass piles of smoking debris and discarded bones along the path. Perhaps an amber supply run did not reach its destination? You press on through the sickly trees until you finally arrive before the sturdy, well-maintained walls of Glimhollow."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_2__a">"Lina, the young girl you rescued from the Satyr's staff, remains afflicted by a mysterious state of slumber. With seemingly no injuries, the healers are at a loss as to what the cause may be.

Finally, one night, you hear stirring from her room. Opening the door, you find her writhing in her bed. The commotion draws the rest of your company as you try to restrain her to stop her from hurting herself.

The moment you touch her, her eyes burst wide open and she unleashes a terrifying scream. Darklight pours from Lina's eyes and mouth as it did when she was tied to the Satyr's staff. You dive for cover."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_2__c">"Energies capable of necrotizing flesh lash out, throwing the room into ruins. As quickly as it began, the eruption subsides. Lina holds her hands over her eyes, momentarily vulnerable. If that happens again in a crowded area many could die. You owe this girl for what she did in the Satyr's realm, but does that debt involve risking your life and the lives of others?


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_3__a">"You've made your decision. The girl is a danger to you and everyone else in The Broken Oak. 

With one swift movement of your blade, the girl falls still. Hopefully, she may now be at peace."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_4__a">"As you slowly approach her, you ask if she remembers you or anything that happened in the realm of madness. She seems to relax a bit as she tries to piece everything together. The clearest memory she has is of two huge eyes she saw in the woods that lured her away from her village. She tells you how she felt drawn to them as they called her deeper and deeper into the forest. 

Aside from that memory, everything else feels like a half remembered dream to her or a jumble of random moments. Her only other recollection is feeling completely powerless against the beast's commands while tied to that staff. The thought triggers a fresh batch of memories and immediately reduces the girl to tears.


Choose one:"</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_5__c">"You place a gentle hand on her shoulder. The contact is all it takes for her to fling her arms around you as if you were The Wire Road itself.

After a long moment, Lina gathers herself. \"I can still feel it inside me. Like worms in my stomach. How do I keep it from coming out again?\" she asks.

You tell her you do not know how, but you promise you will be there to protect her if it does. As you look at the charred gashes in the walls caused by the explosion of Darklight, a part of you wonders what you may have just gotten yourself into."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_6__c">"The girl cannot stay here. The last thing you need is a child with strange powers blowing holes in your inn. You consider ending her right here, though she did lead you out of that cursed realm of unreality. You owe her. The Inquisition may track her down one day, but with luck she'll be able to hide what she truly is and find some semblance of a normal life. Whatever is to become of her, you tell Lina she must leave in the morning. As you decide her fate, Lina's eyes never meet yours. The tears that fill her eyes tell you all you need to know."</string>
    <string name="chp9_19_8__a">"Nights later, the inn is packed and it seems like half of Verum is crammed into The Broken Oak. Apparently, word has spread that this area of the city is considered to be relatively plague free.

You settle into your usual table and the evening's conversation turns to the origin of the Unknown Horrors you had encountered upon leaving Verum.

Midge's legs swing as he sits on one of the beams above you, sitting next to him copying his every move is the Mute Boy you saved from Bastone. He still does not talk, but he and Midge have become fast friends. The younger boy becoming the older one's shadow, picking up his mannerisms. Although speech still eludes him he is a fast study and he has picked up little bits of The Knock here and there that Greycane has taught him. This has given him just enough skill to communicate when he dislikes Bram's cooking, which the others find amusing. It feels good to have a bit of laughter around the place."</string>

Midge's legs swing as he sits on one of the beams above you, occasionally pelting you with nut shells and swiping pieces of bread or cheese from your plates."</string>
    <string name="chp9_2_2__a">As the Mayor speaks, you notice the housekeeper, Eliah, peeking around the corner of a doorframe, clearly eavesdropping. Not the actions of a loyal housekeeper by any means.</string>
    <string name="chp9_2_3__a">"It's hard to tell whether it is your presence, or the topic of conversation, that makes the Mayor so uneasy. But when you ask him for more information about the monster, his voice trembles slightly, clearly nervous now. 

\"It attacks on the eve of each new moon,\" he informs you. \"It comes to feed and then just disappears again. Tomorrow is such a moon. I have not seen it myself,\" he says walking to the entrance of his manor, \"But the villagers and guards can tell you more.\"

As you listen to the man, you cannot shake the feeling that there is something else, hidden somewhere beneath the surface here. A secret they wish to keep from you. Time will tell, as for the moment, it appears you will need to deal with this monster soon enough.

\"Honestly, I am quite relieved to have your Free Company here to help in these dire times,\" the Mayor adds. \"I can assure you, once this matter is dealt with, we will be able to reopen the supply lines to Verum at once.\"

    <string name="chp9_2_4__a">"You thank the Mayor for his time and tell him you will see yourselves out. A passing glance back toward the man, as you leave the library, finds an anxious smile on his face. 

Eliah, the housekeeper, waits by the front door to bid you a good evening and as you are about to exit, you confront her about her eavesdropping on your conversation with the Mayor.

\"I beg your pardon, my lords? You must be mistaken. I was assisting in the kitchen while you were with the Mayor. I would never do such a thing as you suggest. You must be so tired after such a difficult day.\"

She returns your stare, and a moment of silence makes it clear you won't get much from her without using more aggressive tactics. You don't want the people of the village to see you interrogating one of their own, yet you know what you saw. As if reading your thoughts, Eliah smiles and bids you good night."</string>
    <string name="chp9_2_5__a">"Location 2 - Mayor's House"</string>
    <string name="chp9_2_5__c">"You are led to the Mayor's house near the edge of the village. It's a very large home and in rather good condition, but far more simplistic than you would expect for the lord of a town.

All of the buildings here boast a sturdy construction and you notice glimmers of light reflecting off the dark, wooden planks of their doors and walls. As you pass, you realize streaks of amber run throughout each plank of wood, much like the main gate. You have never seen an entire town built strictly from Deepwood lumber before. Perhaps the Mayor can shed some light on this peculiar design choice.

A tall woman with red hair opens the door to greet you and introduces herself as Eliah, the housekeeper, as she welcomes you inside.

You are escorted to a library not far from the home's main entrance where the Mayor awaits. He is a gaunt man with shifty eyes and hands that never seem to stop moving. His fidgety nature seems to be more akin to restlessness than nerves. Nevertheless, he greets you warmly as he tugs on a bell pull. You hear the ring faintly from another room.

\"You are welcome Oathsworn, you must be famished from your travels,\" he says, tapping his fingers along the back of a chair. \"My kitchen will bring you food and drink at once. While we wait, please tell me what brings you to our settlement.\" 

As you explain your mission to see the amber supply lines reopened, he informs you of a creature that has been plaguing the village - it has breached the walls more than once and strikes at anyone that tries to pass beyond the walls. 

\"We have lost dozens of haulers and guards already.\""</string>
    <string name="chp9_2_7__a">"You do nothing to hide your irritation as you ask the Mayor what would cause his guards to defy the direct orders of Oathsworn and why you were forced to smash through the gate in order to enter the village.

\"Th- these are troubling times,\" the Mayor offers anxiously. \"Our people live under a blanket of terror. They are afraid to live here and even more afraid to leave. All our attempts to try to reach Verum have failed. We are altogether cut off.\""</string>
    <string name="chp9_epi_1__a">"The ground beneath the Mollusk's noxious corpse sizzles as pools of its acidic saliva dissolve both earth and rock. Villagers emerge from their hiding places to survey the damage and get a closer look at the monster that has plagued them these past months. Amongst the crowd, you spot the mayor of Glimhollow as he exchanges a grateful nod with you. 

Later that night, you find out it seems you have dealt with more than Glimhollow's monster problem. Between the toll you inflicted at the tavern the night before, and your service to the village since, you have allowed the mayor to take back control of Glimhollow, and the few remaining sympathizers have been rounded up.

A final night's stay at the tavern passes without incident and you use the predawn darkness of the following morning to slip quietly away. Without any way to control the Iron Golem, you are forced to leave it behind as the cynic in you wonders if the Watcher will force you to come back and retrieve the cursed thing. Prior to your departure, and perhaps most importantly, you are able to secure the Mayor's assurance that amber shipments will resume immediately. Another contract fulfilled.

The return journey to Verum takes only a day, and as you pass through its mighty gates you immediately call upon The Raven Spire to report the success of your mission."</string>
    <string name="chp9_epi_2__a">"You are instructed to wait in a poorly lit corridor just beyond the portcullis of The Raven Spire's main gate. Tiny mice squeak in the shadows, and more than once, you hear a faint scream emanate from some unknown cavern deep within. Everything about this place evokes a sense of dread and dark secrets. 

Out of nowhere, three robed figures suddenly emerge from the shadows and silently greet you, their garments swaying ever so slightly as if rustled by an imperceptible breeze. Without a word, you proffer the wrapped chunk of white amber from Glimhollow, which one of the Watchers accepts, tucking it beneath his dark robes. 

\"You will be rewarded,\" a voice finally replies. The way the voice plays off the corridor walls makes it seem like all three of the figures spoke at once and sounds similar to the Watcher who originally called upon you at The Broken Oak. Not another word is spoken as the three slowly fade back into the shadows. As you depart, you wonder whether you should be grateful for or suspicious of a reward from the cowled ones.

Finally back at The Broken Oak, you are greeted by the warm amber fires and familiar faces. After a quick spot of dinner and a debrief from Greycane, you retire to your rooms for some well deserved rest. When you wake the next morning, you find Greycane staring out the inn's large front window. With an annoyed, side-eye glance, he informs you there has been a 'delivery' and offers up a small wrapped package. 

Inside the package, a golem control rod. You look out the window and find an Iron Golem standing in front of The Broken Oak, its glowing eyes awaiting your command."</string>
    <string name="chp9_epi_3__a">"You are instructed to wait in a poorly lit corridor just beyond the portcullis of The Raven Spire's main gate. Tiny mice squeak in the shadows, and more than once, you hear a faint scream emanate from some unknown cavern deep within the castle. Everything about this place evokes a sense of dread and dark secrets. 

Out of nowhere, three robed figures suddenly emerge from the shadows and silently greet you, their garments swaying ever so slightly as if rustled by an imperceptible breeze. You take their silence as a cue to begin your explanation of the events that took place in Glimhollow. When finished, you are met with further silence and you get the distinct impression that they suspect you have not been completely forthright in your report.

Without another word spoken they fade back into the shadows. As you depart, you wonder if they are aware of your deception. Regardless of the potential repercussions, you are confident that your decision to keep the white amber out of their hands was the right one. You return to The Broken Oak and hope it will be some time before a Watcher darkens your door again."</string>

The warehouse used to store the amber reserve is the largest building in the village and is the place where amber shipments are prepared for their journey to Verum. As you enter, a clerk tries to bar your way, but one look quickly makes her reconsider stopping you. 

You step inside, trailed by the woman, and find row upon row of shelves barren and a line of empty carts arranged against one wall. Not a trace of amber can be found. You ask the clerk about the absence of the amber and she replies, \"It was moved after the last attack, my lord,\" her focus darting between each member of your group. Heading deeper in, you search where the monster had clearly gained ingress."</string>
    <string name="chp9a_10_2__a">You proceed to investigate the rest of the warehouse, closely examining the trail of debris throughout the building. It dawns on you that the beast may have fed upon the amber stores here. There are only two creatures of this size known to feast upon amber - the Rock Grub, which is only found high in the northern mountains and the Mollusk. It appears that you may be dealing with the latter of the two.</string>
    <string name="chp9a_10_3__a">"You proceed to investigate the rest of the warehouse, searching for any clue that would help explain why the beast would have come here, but are unable to find anything noteworthy.

As you approach the walls you find a guard squad manning the rampart. It seems word of your entrance to the village has got around and this group shows you more respect than the last one. As you question them about the attacks they point to where the creature had breached the palisade to your left. Pressing them further, you ask them if they have noticed anything strange within the village. A guard shrugs, \"Easier to ask what's normal, folks have been acting strange for months now. The mayor seems different too. Not like the other folks, he's always looking over his shoulder. Like he's afraid of something or someone.\"

You decide to pursue the handwritten note you received from the town Apothecary, Zelah. When you arrive at the establishment there is no one minding the store and there are signs of a struggle. Several glass vials have been smashed on the floor and the main door has clearly been kicked in. You've seen enough in your short stay in this place to know she must have been abducted. Someone does not want her speaking with you.

As you search the store for clues, you find a package of unguents and pulses with Zelah's signature written on it. Something about the parcel gives you the impression she intended to give this to you. Her reasons for trying to help you will only be answered if you can find her before it is too late."</string>

A lone, bearded man works the forge at the village Banksmith. As you approach, the look on the craftsman's face tells you he already knows you are not here to purchase armor.

Inevitably, he slips up and mentions something about \"the whispers in the stones\". From there, you find it easy enough to pry out the rest of the details.

The man refers to some \"cult\" that meets down in the amber mines behind one of the inner walls, but swears he never wanted to be part of it. Realizing he just incriminated himself, he attempts to bribe you - offering his stock in exchange for his life. You don't promise the latter but take the iron, it would be forfeit for his crimes.

The homes closest to the village's main gate are the most poorly maintained buildings you have seen thus far. They also lack the obsessive use of amber in their design, a clear indication that the villagers living in this area are on the lower end of the social spectrum. These people seem to be affiliated with the more municipal duties required to preserve life in this isolated town, such as food distribution and labor.

You also find them far more willing to speak with you, as they are eager to discuss the recent disappearances of some of their neighbors. According to them, the missing people are not casualties of the creature, but rather kidnapped by someone from within the village. Petitions to the mayor seem to have fallen on deaf ears.

Helping her up, her face lifts to look at you, \"Oathsworn?\" she asks, then turns her gaze toward the altar at the heart of the cavern. 

\"It spoke through me. It…\" The woman shudders with fear. You ask her what it was and what had happened. \"It was the stone, something, someone in the stone. I could feel its thoughts, memories from another place. It felt trapped, trapped for so very long. I… I tried to get to you before they could… but they came for me. For months they have been taking us, one by one. They used us to speak with it. A vessel, like paper to hold sulfur. It burned up each and every one except me,\" she replies.

    <string name="chp9a_1_12__a">As you inspect the chunks of glowing white stone scattered around the altar, it is obvious to you this is the amber the Watcher is after. He also gave you an important warning about the strange material. You pause for a moment and try to recall what it was.</string>

This substance is clearly far more than just your average hunk of amber. The resin exudes enormous potency.

A large section of the wall has been collapsed inward and a mismatch of stone, wood, and even furniture has been haphazardly stuffed into the gap as a temporary barrier. Judging by the size of the breach, you are in for quite a fight."</string>
    <string name="chp9a_7_2__a">"At first glance, it appears the walls were battered down, but as you look more closely, it also appears the stone has been… melted? Each boulder is coated with a fine dust and deep pitting and scars mar the surfaces, as though whatever substance caused the damage continues to dissolve the stone.

A search of the ground at the base of the wall uncovers a trail of corroded rock leading back into town. Carefully tracking the debris leads you directly to the warehouse used to store the village's amber reserve."</string>
    <string name="chp9a_7_3__a">"An examination of the breach in the wall reveals nothing of consequence. It's clear the beast entered the village here, but you are unable to determine where it went from here.

The homes in this area of the village are of much higher quality than the others you've seen. Amber streaks decorate the houses and doors here in what appears to be deliberate design choices, if not as an outright symbol of status. You have heard that some villages attempt to establish some equality in their settlements, being free to do so, far from the rule of Verum. This village is not one of them.

Maybe you can learn something about your mysterious attackers here. Asking around quickly proves you are not welcome here, you will need to be more persuasive.

    <string name="chp9a_8_2__c">"It turns out iron loosens more tongues here than brute force as you find a merchant willing to trade information for a price. He speaks with you in the privacy of a nearby alley, lest someone discovers he has helped you.

\"Where do you think that lot would've gotten their weapons from?\" he asks, as he nods down the street toward the village Banksmith."</string>
    <string name="chp9a_8_4__a">"Sometimes it takes good old fashioned steel and the threat of bloodshed to open mouths, especially when the sight of the Oathmark itself fails to do the trick. You've chosen a wiry merchant as your target and he cowers before you. 

\"The weapons,\" he pleads. \"They had to get 'em at the Banksmith. I don't know any more. Please!\""</string>
    <string name="chp9a_8_5__a">"When the sight of the Oathmark or the threat of bloodshed fails to do the trick, you are left with little choice but to follow through on your threats. You manage to inflict just enough pain to coerce a stubborn merchant into coughing up information without too much permanent damage. It's an unpleasant endeavor, but effective nonetheless."</string>
    <string name="chp9a_8_5__c">"\"The Banksmith!\" he cries. \"He sold them the weapons! Please don't kill me!\""</string>
    <string name="chp9a_9_1__a">"Location 9 - Town Square

You are surprised to find the town square somewhat lively for such a small village. A few market stalls have been set up, offering food and drink items while others display crafts or jewelry as well as some tinctures. One very common theme amongst the wares is the pervasive use of amber gems."</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_1a__a">"Location 10 - Amber Reserve

The warehouse used to store the amber reserve is the largest building in the village and is the place where all the amber shipments are prepared for their journey to Verum. As you enter, a clerk tries to bar your way, but one look quickly makes her reconsider stopping you. 

You step inside, trailed by the woman, and find row upon row of shelves of amber and a line of carts arranged against one wall. \"Please my lords, be careful, touch nothing,\" the woman anxiously petitions you. Much of the wealth of the village is in this warehouse and there is enough of the explosive material to ensure none of you leaves this place should you trigger a reaction. Making sure to tread lightly, you head deeper in."</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_3__a">As you investigate the warehouse, you come to a large hole in the wall where something huge has obviously broken through. The shelving in this area is in tatters and it seems as though something has partially dissolved the wood and stone. Only the tiniest chips of amber can be found in the debris. Is it possible the creature broke into the reserves to feed upon the amber?</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_3__c">A search of the back of the warehouse uncovers a second storage area tucked away - out of sight. The amber on these shelves is unlike anything you have seen before as it glows a brilliant white, rather than the familiar orange. This must be the mysterious amber the Watcher was so interested in. He also gave you an important warning about the strange material. You pause for a moment to try to recall what it was.</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_4__a">You place the wrapped hunk of amber into your satchel, and make sure not to touch it again.</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_5__a">"You decide there is something far too malefic and twisted about the substance to place it in the hands of a Watcher. Thankfully, returning the amber to Verum is not part of your contract and it won't be difficult to deny you ever saw it. Safely collecting the rest, you resolve to destroy what remains."</string>
    <string name="chp9b_10_7__a">"You suddenly remember the Watcher specifically told you not to touch the stone with bare skin, otherwise there would be 'unpleasant effects'. Using a scrap of fabric, you collect a fist-sized chunk of the stone and carefully wrap it up. As you hold the mysterious rock, a feeling of deep anguish washes over you and you swear you hear faint screaming from somewhere off in the distance. This substance is clearly far more than just your average hunk of amber. The resin exudes enormous potency.

The thoughts give you a moment's pause. Perhaps it would not be in everyone's best interest if a substance like this were to be in the hands of the Watchers. Who knows what they will do with the stone. The contract the Watcher forced you into only requires you to discover the reason behind Glimhollow's recent silence and reestablish the flow of amber back to Verum. There is no mention of recovering this material. On the other hand, you are sure of a reward for completing this additional task and no Free Company crosses the Raven Spire without consequence. Would they find out if you disposed of the stone?

As you approach the walls you find a guard squad manning the rampart. It seems word of your entrance to the village has got around and this group shows you more respect than the last one. As you question them about the attacks they point to where the creature had breached the palisade to your left. \"It broke through like it was nothing,\" one of the guards informs you. \"Went straight into the Amber Warehouse and on to the Town Square after that, surely to eat people.\" 

You press them further for details on the creature itself but the guards give the usual vague answers of those uninitiated in hunting the creatures of the Deepwood. You can discern that it was big and seemed to have no legs, though that is true of dozens of species on record. You are about to end your conversation with the guards when one pipes up.

\"There was something strange when it went to the Town Square though,\" he adds. \"There were barrels of salted meat over there. When it slithered into them, I saw the thing recoil in pain and head off in the other direction after that.\""</string>
    <string name="chp9b_11_2__a">"Your experience has taught you some creatures have extreme reactions to certain substances, particularly salt. If you had to guess, it was the salt in the meat that caused a burn of some kind to the beast's flesh. This is an important piece of information that may come in handy later."</string>
    <string name="chp9b_11_3__a">Based on what you can gather here, the beast eats people and usually attacks from the Northeast. Not much to go on.</string>

As you pass the Apothecary store, you recall the note Zelah left in your room at the tavern before the ambush.

The homes closest to the village's main gate are the most poorly maintained buildings you have seen thus far. They also lack the obsessive use of amber in their design, a clear indication that the villagers living in this area are on the lower end of the social spectrum. These people seem to be affiliated with the more servile duties required to preserve life in this isolated village.

You also find them far more willing to speak with you, but they are careful not to let anyone see them in your presence. According to the people here, several villagers had gone missing even before the beast started attacking the village. No bodies have ever been found though.

With everything ready, you make your way to the Northeast area of the village and get to work on setting the trap, just within the wall where it had come through before. A large pile of orange amber is placed, and above it you suspend the barrel of salt from a thick rope. With the preparations complete, you take up defensive positions and wait. 

Only moments pass before the alarm sounds. Guards shout orders to one another and a few lose their nerve, and run off toward the amber mines. The village wall begins to smoke and it suddenly collapses inward right before your eyes. An undulating mass of reeking, acid flesh bursts into the village. Melting rock and timber, it leaves a smoking trail of mucus in its wake. 

Your plan works and as it stops to feast on the amber you yank on the rope. Salt rains down on the creature and its skin begins to hiss as the substance burns through its moist body. It rears up in agony, and sensing you have the advantage, you charge into battle. This is going to get messy."</string>

You follow the trail into the Deepwood. Not too far in, the ground gives way to a large body of water, a fetid swamp. You know better than to wade in there and keep your distance from the edge. Walking along the bank you study the water's surface for signs of the creature. As you do so, a strange acidic smell fills your nostrils."</string>

Based on the information you gathered from the Wall Guards, the creature seems to have an aversion to salt - the substance may even harm it. Perhaps if you can acquire a barrel of salt, you can lay a trap for the creature. 

As a Free Company, you are well within your authority to confiscate the salt from the villagers. However, if you hope to stay in their good graces and maintain some semblance of cooperation, it may be in your best interest to purchase the salt from one of the merchants.
